# GOVERNANCE FUTURES: KEY INSIGHTS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS

**Abstract:** Governance systems at the global, national, and local levels are at a critical juncture. As the world grows more volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous, there is a growing belief that they are unfit to effectively address both present and future challenges, as well as meet people's needs and new aspirations. How governments together with other stakeholders prepare for the future will significantly impact people's well-being, both now and in the years to come. This Policy Brief outlines the limitations of present governance systems and explores alternative future governance models that can effectively address current complex challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. It does so by examining key drivers of change across the political, economic, social, technological, and environmental spheres— and how these issues and their interlinkages may shape governance systems by 2040. Using strategic foresight, the Policy Brief aims to deepen our understanding of the complex dynamics shaping the future of governance and provides insights into potential pathways for transformational change to enable the design of forward-looking, anticipatory policies.

# I. INTRODUCTION
## The role of governance in society

Governance systems at all levels have profound and far-ranging implications for society, the environment, and the economy. How societies govern themselves plays a significant role in ensuring the well-being of all people and fostering sustainable development. The type of governance influences whether people can achieve their full potential and whether physical, mental, and social well-being are safeguarded.

Global governance is "a framework of institutions, rules, norms, and procedures that facilitates collective action and cooperation among countries and other actors to address complex, cross-border challenges related to economic development, trade, human rights, environmental protection, and peace and security."¹ In this sense, global governance operates through a network of formal and informal multilateral mechanisms that facilitate collaboration and manage conflict on a global scale. Governance at the national and subnational levels refers to the exercise of political and administrative authority to manage a country's affairs. It is a "system of values, policies, and institutions through which societies manage economic, political, and social affairs by engaging the state, civil society, and the private sector."² It includes the institutions, mechanisms, and processes through which citizens and groups articulate their interests, exercise their legal rights, meet their obligations, and mediate their differences³. At the heart of governance systems lies the social contract, which forms the bedrock of values, principles and interests guiding the relationship between the state and its people, and the conduct across all levels of society. Throughout history, governance systems have continuously evolved through the interplay of political dynamics, leadership styles, societal changes, technological advancements, and global developments. Each era has introduced challenges

## Key Messages
- Governance institutions must adapt to rapid technological, geopolitical, and societal shifts and become more agile, adaptable, and forward-looking.
- For governance to be more agile and anticipatory, institutions must embrace strategic foresight as a critical tool for resilience and adaptability.
- Strategic foresight empowers policymakers to anticipate disruptions, manage emerging risks, and design governance models that are resilient, inclusive, and better prepared for the future.
- Based on the strategic foresight conducted for the policy brief, the desirable future of governance could be shaped by technological advancement, participatory governance, and decentralization.

and opportunities that have both influenced and have been influenced by governance practices.

Today, we are at an inflection point for governance systems at all levels, driven by a perceived disconnect between societal needs, values and aspirations, and the ability of these systems to fulfil them. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development⁴ sets a vision for democracy, good governance, and the rule of law, yet the present situation suggests a widening gap between this vision and its implementation. To meet this challenge, governance models must evolve. The 11 principles of effective governance for sustainable development, which were endorsed by the UN Economic and Social Council, provide a framework for change and expert guidance to interested countries on a broad range of governance challenges associated with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This policy brief explores the limitations of current governance systems and transformative pathways to build adaptive and inclusive governance systems. By using strategic foresight⁵, it examines cross-cutting issues in different domains that might shape governance systems at all levels in 2040 and beyond. It also provides recommendations for the United Nations System, the UN Member States, as well as Non-State and Sub-National Actors. The table below summarizes the policy brief's structure.

# II. CURRENT CONTEXT
## Challenges and limitations of current governance systems in a changing world
According to a recent United Nations report on Goal 16 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, "progress on violence reduction, access to justice, inclusive governance and peaceful societies is stagnating or in reverse"⁶. The UN Sustainable Development Goals Report 2024 cautions that with just six years remaining to 2030, current progress falls far short of what is required to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It highlights that "urgent action is needed to combat corruption and organized crime, strengthen the rule of law and access to justice, build effective and inclusive governance institutions, and protect rights and fundamental freedoms."⁷

Public institutions in many countries across the world seem to be ineffective and no longer serve their intended purpose. This disconnect between institutions and the needs of today's world is underscored by the United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres who recently stated that "we cannot effectively address problems as they are if institutions don't reflect the world as it is. Instead of solving problems, they risk becoming part of the problem."⁸

Primarily developed in the 20th century, the present governance systems were tailored to address that era's specific challenges and aspirations. Yet, the global landscape of the 21st century has evolved dramatically. It presents many new complexities and challenges that have exposed the limitations of these traditional governance systems. Unlike in the past, today's interconnected crises, from climate change to escalating conflicts, require governance frameworks that are more adaptable, collaborative, and forward-thinking.

At the regional and global levels, current governance systems seem to fall short of the required mandates and capacities to effectively manage transboundary challenges. The year 2023 saw a concerning rise in military conflicts and global defense expenditures, underscoring the persistent volatility in international relations and the need for more effective conflict resolution mechanisms.⁹ In addition to global crises, national governments also face an array of national pressing

issues that further challenge their ability to respond to people's needs and aspirations. While governance systems in many countries have made significant progress in reducing extreme poverty and fostering economic prosperity and development, they have struggled to manage rising inequalities, debt, and inflation. They have also faced challenges in responding to interconnected global crises while simultaneously addressing complex issues such as digital transformation, demographic shifts, migration, rapid urbanization, and climate change. These factors have hindered progress toward the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Moreover, these challenges are compounded by the rapid pace of change, which is unparalleled in human history. Technological advancements, especially Artificial Intelligence, are reshaping societies faster than governance systems can adapt. While some public institutions have demonstrated resilience and ability to innovate—embracing digital governance and agile policymaking—many still fail to quickly adapt and anticipate new societal demands and effectively respond to emerging crises. They remain overly siloed, constrained by rigid hierarchies and legacy systems that are outdated and ill-suited for the digital age. As a result, they lack the flexibility, innovation, and collaborative mechanisms necessary for societies to navigate an increasingly complex and uncertain future.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed and exacerbated the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of today's public institutions and their capacity to tackle socio-economic challenges. On the one hand, it has demonstrated the capacity of governments to act swiftly and promote innovations in the health sector and public service delivery. On the other hand, it has made visible in many countries the lack of coordination among different levels of government¹⁰.

As policymakers struggle to keep pace with evolving public expectations, in many countries the social contract between governance institutions and society is under strain. While some governance models have adapted, others risk becoming outdated and unable to fulfill the aspirations of both present and future generations. This is evidenced by the growing lack of trust in public institutions, decline in voter turnout, rising political polarization and anti-institutional movements.¹¹ It is also evident in the inability of many current governance systems and policies to bridge the gaps between the haves and have nots. Trust in public institutions is waning, not merely due to poor service delivery but because citizens increasingly feel that these institutions no longer represent or uphold the principles of fairness, inclusiveness, and justice¹². Therefore, the growing governance crisis is not just about inefficiency or outdated institutions; it is a deeper reflection of diverging and, in some cases, eroding shared societal values.¹³

Without a renewed consensus on the values underpinning governance systems and how they are being translated into practice, institutions risk losing legitimacy and becoming ineffective. In this respect, the UN Secretary-General has called for a new social contract that redefines the relationships between governments, citizens, and institutions to address the mounting challenges of inequality, systemic injustice, and the effects of crises like climate change, pandemics, and economic instability.¹⁴

From economic instability to rapid technological and demographic changes, these challenges require long-term, strategic policy responses. For example, the pursuit of economic growth without accounting for environmental consequences endangers both the planet and the well-being of present and future generations. Many governments, however, are unwilling or unable to make difficult choices that prioritize long-term perspectives over short-term political gains. Nonetheless, discussions are emerging on new ways to measure development, moving beyond economic indicators to include aspects like individual well-being, social welfare, and sustainability.

The need for resilience, the ability to navigate uncertainty, and the foresight to anticipate risks have never been more urgent. In light of these urgent challenges, merely recognizing governance failures is no longer sufficient—we must also chart a path forward. The key question now is: where do we go from here? What direction, values, and type of governance institutions are needed to tackle both current and future challenges and opportunities?

# III. KEY MAJOR FORCES OF CHANGE AFFECTING GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS

As we move toward 2040 and beyond, the world will become increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA). Various drivers of change will shape governance systems at all levels. As Li Junhua, United Nations Under Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, stated, "we face a future where shocks, such as those from climate change, are not only more frequent, but are also more likely to turn into full blown crises that spread rapidly across countries, with concurrent and compounding effects across environmental, economic, and social systems".¹⁵ To

navigate these complexities, governance systems must embrace strategic foresight as a critical tool for resilience and adaptability.

By systematically analyzing emerging trends and uncertainties, policymakers can better anticipate challenges and design forward-looking, anticipatory solutions. The Pact for the Future, adopted by UN Member States in 2024, highlights the importance of long-term thinking in governance and urges governments to adopt anticipatory, adaptive, and responsive strategies to address emerging challenges.¹⁶

A foresight exercise undertaken for this policy brief (see Section IV) identified four key factors as major forces shaping governance systems toward 2040: (1) geopolitical dynamics, (2) technological advancements, (3) shifts in social behaviors, and (4) the rise of non-state and sub-national actors.

## Geopolitical Dynamics
### Declining Trust in International Institutions
Institutions such as the United Nations, Bretton Woods Institutions, and the World Health Organization have been instrumental in promoting global peace and development. They have provided platforms for diplomatic dialogue, economic cooperation, and financial assistance that have helped mitigate conflicts, foster growth, and reduce poverty worldwide.

However, outdated power structures and imbalances have weakened these institutions' ability to respond decisively to crises and conflicts. For example, the UN Security Council's veto system, controlled by its five permanent members, frequently blocks swift action in humanitarian emergencies and political conflicts. By 2022, approximately two billion people were living in conflict-affected regions,¹⁷ while the number of refugees and internally displaced persons reached a record high of over 89 million in 2021.¹⁸ Global military expenditures surpassed $2 trillion¹⁹ and by May 2024, the number of forcibly displaced people reached a staggering 120 million.²⁰ Conflicts and crises, especially those resulting in large numbers of refugees or displaced persons, challenge the resilience of national and international institutions.²¹ On a global scale, military conflict have profound implications for governance, both directly and indirectly, shaping international relations, economic systems, security frameworks, and trust in global institutions.

As global power dynamics shift, there is a growing demand for governance reforms that establish more equitable, representative frameworks—ones that reflect the diverse needs of today's world and amplify the voices of the Global South. The decline of trust in international institutions has weakened their relevance and effectiveness at a time when global cooperation is more crucial than ever to address transboundary issues that no single state can solve alone²². To address these challenges, global governance systems must strengthen their capacity to handle emergencies, requiring reforms in governance structures, funding, and cross-border collaboration.

### Shifting Centers of Power, Interests and Alliances
The inability of international organizations to address challenges such as conflict, climate change, pandemics, and financial crises has led to the formation of new political alliances and the realignment of centers of powers and interests. At a ministerial meeting in September 2023, held in preparation for the Summit of the Future²³, the UN Secretary-General stated that the world is becoming multipolar, creating new opportunities for countries to take leadership roles on the global stage. He cautioned, however, that multipolarity without strong multilateral institutions poses serious risks, potentially leading to increased geostrategic tensions, chaotic competition, and further fragmentation. He emphasized that "multilateral institutions will only survive if they are truly universal".²⁴ Yet, international governance systems continue to struggle to accommodate emerging powers and fail to adequately represent all voices, particularly those of the Global South.

The rise of the Global South, especially with Alliances like BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and its expansion to BRICS+²⁵, reflect a growing quest for more representative governance systems. These nations, often regarded as emerging economies and geopolitical players, are demanding greater influence in global governance and more equitable solutions to global problems. They are increasingly challenging the current global order, particularly in the realms of trade, security, and global decision-making. This is particularly important for tackling challenges like climate change, where the Global South is disproportionately

impacted but often excluded from key decision-making processes as those on climate change.²⁶ These coalitions are not only advocating for reforms in global governance but also shaping new economic and political models that align with their interests and priorities. This could lead to more diverse international approaches and responses to global challenges, although the effectiveness of these emerging coalitions remains to be fully tested.

### Rising Protectionism and Trade Conflicts
The global economy is undergoing powerful transformations, with new business models emerging that challenge existing economic paradigms and governance systems at all levels. While globalization, through economic integration, has expanded markets and lowered costs, it has also exposed inequalities and vulnerabilities.

Crises like COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine have further exposed the risks of over-reliance on specific regions for critical goods (e.g., tech, automotive, pharmaceuticals), turning global supply chains from efficiency drivers into potential economic liabilities and security risks²⁷. This has led to a reevaluation of trade policies and a surge in protectionism in many countries, driven by domestic dynamics. Governments have adopted tariffs and import restrictions to safeguard domestic industries, reduce trade imbalances, and create jobs.²⁸ National industrial policies are gaining traction, focusing on strategic sectors to reduce reliance on foreign technologies and enhance economic resilience. Environmental and ethical considerations are also reshaping trade, with rising demand for products that meet labor and sustainability standards. These trends are leading to new regional and ideological alignments and the steady erosion of traditional multilateral trade agreements and the dispute resolution mechanisms of the World Trade Organization.²⁹

### Global Inequality and the Financial Architecture
Economic vulnerabilities and power imbalances, driven by global inequality, financial crises, and a growing informal sector are reshaping international relations. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, governments introduced emergency measures, stimulus packages, and financial reforms to stabilize their economies and maintain public trust. However, these interventions have significantly increased debt burdens and strained fiscal capacity, particularly in developing countries. The war in Ukraine, along with the resulting food and energy crises, has further exacerbated the global debt levels and added financial pressures, pushing public borrowing to record highs. This situation, characterized by rising interest rates, currency depreciation, and declining exports, has worsened the development crisis, especially for low- and lower-middle-income countries.³⁰ Debt service payments for these nations surged from 6% of revenue in 2010 to 16% in 2021, diverting resources from the SDGs.³¹ With nearly a third of these countries facing debt distress, the calls for governance reforms are mounting to improve debt transparency and management.³² Momentum is increasing for international financial reforms³³, including improved tax cooperation and fair tax practices to address systemic vulnerabilities. The UN General Assembly has established an intergovernmental negotiating committee to draft a United Nations Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation. This process, running from 2025 to 2027, aims to create a more inclusive and effective system for setting international tax rules, focusing on financial transparency and the elimination of tax havens³⁴.

### Climate Change as an Existential Global Threat
The scale and complexity of the climate change challenge calls for a reevaluation of global governance frameworks. Global alliances and climate governance structures are evolving, creating new coalitions but also deepening divides between developed and developing nations over climate finance and responsibilities. Leadership in sustainable innovation and resource control is becoming a key determinant of geopolitical dynamics. The growing focus on sustainability and climate-related technologies in certain regions is transforming global geopolitics by altering energy dependencies, intensifying competition for critical minerals, and driving new economic policies.

Climate change-induced displacement and resource scarcity are fueling migration and geopolitical tensions, while military strategies are adapting to environmental challenges, including competition in the Arctic. Resource depletion (including energy, food, and water) is intensifying competition among nations for these vital supplies. This competition, where major powers seek to secure reliable access to these resources, could lead to a breakdown in global cooperation in other areas. Resource scarcities are expected to disproportionally impact poorer nations, potentially sparking internal

or interstate conflict, causing spillover effects, and regional destabilization.35 Thus, nations must collaborate more effec- tively, recognizing the interconnected nature of the climate crisis. This calls for coordinated global policies, investment in sustainable technologies, and fair distribution of resources in line with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Without strong governance structures, the global community risks failing to mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change, which could exacerbate global inequalities and trigger wide- spread political instability.

## Technological Advancements

Technology has become an increasingly powerful driver of change, with advancements accelerating across numerous sectors. The "Fourth Industrial Revolution," defined by the convergence of cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intel- ligence (AI), automation, the Internet of Things (IoT), block- chain, biotechnology, and quantum computing, is reshap- ing governance systems at both global and national levels. These innovations are transforming the way we live, work, and connect, presenting both opportunities and challenges in governance36.

## The Emergence of Data Diplomacy

The rise of the digital economy and Al technologies marks a major shift toward a more interconnected, data-driven global system, where decisions and interactions are increasingly shaped by digital infrastructure37. This transformation is re- defining global political dynamics, elevating the geopolitical significance of data and investments in data centers. While Al competition has primarily focused on advanced semiconduc- tors, it also relies heavily on massive data resources and ex- tensive data center infrastructure. As a result, data diplomacy is becoming a crucial element of international collaboration.

In his essay "The Next Al Debate Is About Geopolitics," Jaren Cohen, President of Global Affairs at Goldman Sachs, de- scribes data as the "new oil."38 However, unlike oil, the place- ment of data centers will be determined by nations rather than nature, carrying significant geopolitical consequences. Goldman Sachs predicts that major tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta will invest approxi- mately $600 billion in Al-related data center infrastructure, further intensifying competition in this space. As the Al race accelerates, forging strategic global partnerships will be crucial for maintaining leadership in the field. These new al- liances will shape the landscape of "data center diplomacy,” as nations seek like-minded partners to host these critical fa- cilities. As technological corporations wield immense influ- ence over societies, politics, and economies worldwide, their growing power, which now extends beyond national borders, is increasingly challenging the authority of sovereign govern- ments and international institutions. Their dominance over digital technologies and platforms highlights the growing in- tersection between corporate power and governance, rede- fining the global order and raising questions about the future of state-centric global governance models.

## Digital Governance

At the national and sub-national levels, technological ad- vancements present significant potential to improve gov- ernance systems.39 Digital governance initiatives have made public services more accessible and personalized, while real- time data analysis helps track spending, detect inefficien- cies, and combat financial fraud. Al's ability to analyze vast datasets allows governments to predict trends, optimize pol- icy outcomes, and enhance public services. By automating routine tasks, Al-driven tools like chatbots can improve re- sponsiveness, while smart city applications help optimize traffic, energy use, and waste management. Quantum com- puting promises to transform governance by improving fore- casting, risk management, and decision-making in areas like national security and economic management.40

The widespread adoption of emerging technologies in gov- ernance, however, also poses risks, including data privacy breaches, cybersecurity threats, increased surveillance, and Al algorithmic biases that may reinforce discrimination. The over-reliance on digital systems whose technical failures could disrupt critical services, such as healthcare, education, and tax systems, may also erode public trust in digital gov- ernance, especially in developing countries. Effective man- agement of these challenges and the implementation of ro- bust security measures are key to unlocking the potential of new technologies in governance.41

Legislative frameworks for e-government development are essential for ensuring data privacy, cybersecurity, interoper- ability, and accessibility while promoting transparency, effi- ciency, and inclusive digital services in public administra- tion. According to the UN E-Government Survey 2024, and

as shown in Figure 1 below, "between 81 and 83 per cent of countries have national e-government strategies, policies or legislation on cybersecurity, data privacy, and data protec- tion, 78 per cent require citizens to use a digital ID when ac- cessing public services, and 76 per cent offer public access to legislation on the right of citizens to access government information. The shares are lower for legislation or policies on open government data (63 per cent), e-participation (51 per cent), protecting the public against misinformation, disin- formation, and/or fake news (47 per cent), and frontier tech- nologies such as cloud computing (44 per cent) and artificial intelligence (42 per cent). Regional disparities are more pro- nounced for these last five indicators; more than half of the countries in Asia and Europe have already adopted relevant legislation, policies or strategies, the average for the Amer- icas is slightly above 30 per cent and that for Africa slightly below 30 per cent, and in Oceania the compliance rates range from 4 to 11 per cent.

## Impacts of Technology on Political Engagement and Social Cohesion

Over 30 percent of the global population now uses social me- dia platforms to connect, learn, and share information.42 Dig- italization, Al, and social media have revolutionized access to information and expanded platforms for civic and politi- cal engagement, influencing the political discourse. They have enabled direct interaction among citizens, politicians, and government institutions. Individuals are more empow- ered to voice opinions, organize protests, and rally support for various causes, such as climate change, human rights, and social justice through online petitions, and social media campaigns to influence policy decisions. Smartphones and social media have also increased the ability to document and expose government actions, such as abuses or corruption, holding authorities accountable in real time.43Al can detect patterns of fraudulent activity, reduce bureaucratic delays,

and combat the spread of fake news, ensuring that citizens receive accurate information.

The use of these technologies, however, can also lead to di- visive political discourse that may potentially undermine key democratic norms and institutions.44 As people increasingly use social media as their main source of information, polariza- tion and the spread of false information has been on the rise45, facilitated by the lack of regulations usually applied to tradi- tional media and the concentration of ownership of social me- dia platforms.46 Misinformation can erode trust in traditional political parties and media. It can also threaten social cohe- sion, creating online echo chambers that can foster divisive discourse and hinder meaningful civic engagement.

Social media campaigns also have the potential to transform societal norms related to gender, race, and environmental is- sues, fostering new forms of activism while also intensifying ideological divisions. These changes in values are disrupting traditional social structures and giving rise to new social be- haviors and dynamics. In addition, youth-led movements are increasingly demanding transparency and accountability. They are questioning conventional governance models and political involvement, potentially leading to either more cen- tralized or more fragmented political systems.

## Technological Transformation of the Global Economy

New technologies are transforming production, management, and economic models across industries, boosting productiv- ity and efficiency, with automation reducing costs and driv- ing innovation.47 Entire sectors from logistics, to healthcare, and finance have been transformed with the introduction of Al, blockchain, and IoT, while global connectivity and e-com- merce have broken down geographical barriers, disrupting la- bor markets and challenging existing labor laws.48

New technologies are also offering solutions for climate change and resource management. Al is helping to enhance climate change mitigation efforts, providing tools for environ- mental monitoring and early warning systems.49 However, Al itself can also have a detrimental environmental effect since data centers use significant amounts of energy50, calling for rebalancing policies.

## Addressing the Digital Divides

The 2024 UN E-Government Survey emphasizes that inclusiv- ity should be a guiding principle in digital transformation, ad- vocating for "inclusion by design" over "digital by default" to ensure equitable access to e-government services. Countries must address disparities by prioritizing accessible, affordable, and user-friendly digital services, alongside investments in digital literacy and infrastructure, to truly leave no one behind.

Many countries still struggle with digital connectivity and liter- acy, highlighting disparities in the access and use of technol- ogy51. Currently, around 3.6 billion people lack internet access, preventing them from accessing vital resources that could help them develop and prosper in the 21st century52. Lack of inter- net access and literacy, particularly in rural areas and in poorer countries, will deprive many of the opportunities to participate in the digital economy or take full advantage of online educa- tion, healthcare, and government services. Even when technol- ogy is available, they might not have the skills to navigate on- line platforms, use software, or stay safe from cyber threats.

As technological innovation takes center stage, the digital di- vide between and within nations, if not addressed will grow exponentially. Countries that successfully integrate digital and Al technologies into their industries are poised to expe- rience significant economic growth, driven by productivity gains. Those facing digital barriers risk falling further behind, increasing inequalities, social tensions and geopolitical rival- ries over access and control of new technologies.

As digital technologies evolve, Governments in developing countries will struggle to acquire emerging technologies like Al, cloud and quantum computing due to limited financial re- sources and lack of specialized knowledge to effectively use, monitor and regulate them53. They will also struggle to com- pete with the technological capabilities of large corporations or more advanced countries. Financial and expertise limita- tions hinder many developing countries from acquiring and regulating emerging technologies, potentially widening the gap between technologically advanced nations and those lagging behind. Operating in a globalized digital space, will also make it challenging to address issues of data privacy,

cybercrime, and digital currencies without international coop- eration. Differences in legal frameworks, cultural values, and political priorities among countries complicate efforts to es- tablish cohesive governance structures that would consider the needs of less advance countries. The Global Digital Com- pact (GDC), adopted during the 2023 UN Summit of the Future, calls for the creation of an international framework for digital cooperation. It aims to ensure that digital technologies, includ- ing Al, cloud computing, and quantum computing, are used in ways that are inclusive, safe, and equitable, especially for de- veloping countries. One of the goals of the GDC is to find com- mon ground between countries while respecting their sover- eignty and ensuring that governance structures are adaptable to different national contexts.

## Adapting Regulatory Frameworks to Rapid Technological Changes

The technological transformation of the global economy is challenging current regulations, labor markets, international competitiveness, and global power dynamics that are bound to reshape governance.54 However, governance institutions often lack the capacity to keep up with rapid technological change and anticipate citizens' needs while managing asso- ciated risks.

Governments will need to respond to these challenges by up- dating their laws, ensuring equitable access to technology, and carefully navigating partnerships with private tech com- panies55. Outdated labor laws fail to protect workers in an era of automation and gig economies, while cybersecurity, data privacy, and Al governance remain largely unregulated. They must reconsider labor laws and worker protections while ad- dressing cross-border challenges such as taxation and im- migration. A failure to modernize legal systems risks eroding public trust and fuel social unrest. Effective governance in the digital age will require adaptive legal frameworks that bal- ance security, individual rights, and technological innovation.

## Shifts in Social Behaviors

Social behavior shifts driven by political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal trends will undoubt- edly have a profound impact on governance systems across the globe. These trends are already shaping how people inter- act, governments operate, and power is distributed, which will in turn change how people engage with politics, business, and each other.

## Growing Distrust in National Governments

In many countries, trust in government has been steadily de- clining due to its inability to effectively address the needs and aspirations of citizens. Widening socio-economic disparities, governance inefficiencies, and escalating crises have further eroded confidence in public institutions, fostering political polarization and shifts in societal norms. Perceptions of in- equality and poverty influence public attitudes toward gov- ernance, undermining social cohesion, and overall stability.

Job displacement, financial instability, and the changes in business and labor dynamics are fueling calls for more robust social safety nets and greater economic inclusion. As citizens demand more from their governments, pressure is mount- ing to prioritize policies that reduce socio-economic divides. These sometimes include progressive taxation, social welfare programs, and investments in education and job training. So- cial progress and inclusion are expected to become key pri- orities in governance, especially in light of rapid technological changes and their impact on the labour market.

## Social and Cultural Shifts due to Globalization and Migration

Globalization and migration are reshaping governance world- wide. While these forces can enrich societies and create eco- nomic opportunities, they can also disrupt social cohesion and challenge state policies on integration and security. Gov- ernments face increasing pressure to balance the needs and rights of increasingly diverse populations while maintaining social stability. Migration, cultural shifts, and conflicts often fuel social movements advocating for the rights of margin- alized groups, putting additional pressure on governments. The latter could lead to significant reforms or, in some cases, to the restriction of civil liberties if these movements are per- ceived as threats to stability.

Governments must adapt their legal systems to address the complexities of global mobility, cross-border commerce, and international agreements. However, they may struggle to rec- oncile global standards with deeply rooted cultural or religious values, local traditions, or governance practices. In some cases, the challenges brought about by globalization and mi- gration have led to social tensions, economic inequalities, po- litical instability, and policy dilemmas. These challenges can strain public resources, fuel nationalist sentiments, and create difficulties in governance, particularly in balancing integration with local economic and cultural interests.56 These dynamics have sparked populist and nationalist movements aimed at limiting immigration and challenging multilateral governance frameworks.

Additionally, climate-induced displacement and geopolitical tensions may also accelerate deglobalization sentiments, forc- ing governments to reconsider policies on economic self-suffi- ciency and migration control. Moreover, diasporas play a signif- icant role in influencing governance both in their host countries and countries of origin, shaping political engagement through remittances, advocacy, and economic investment.

Furthermore, migration from rural areas to cities often accel- erates urbanization, creating disparities in resources, public services, and political representation. As a result, local gov- ernments or regions may gain more autonomy in managing issues traditionally handled by central authorities.

## Climate Change and Social Activism

Natural disasters, climate change, and environmental deg- radation are raising social awareness and sparking activism around issues like health, inequality, migration, resource us- age, and economic priorities.

Climate change has been a catalyst for social and political ac- tivism and a driving force for governance reform over the past few decades.57 As people become more attuned to environ- mental issues, social values among certain groups are shifting toward sustainability, minimalism, and environmental steward- ship. Public awareness has surged, fueling large-scale move- ments such as Fridays for Future and Extinction Rebellion, which demand systemic policy shifts. As environmental con- cerns reshape social values, many individuals and corpora- tions are adopting sustainability practices, affecting consumer behavior, investment strategies, and policy priorities.58

In some countries, especially among the members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Governments face increasing pressure to enact stricter environmental regulations, invest in green technol- ogies, and develop climate adaptation and mitigation poli- cies.59 However, the transition to a low-carbon economy pre- sents significant socio-economic challenges, particularly in fossil fuel-dependent regions. Job losses, economic disrup- tions, and ideological divides over environmental policies have intensified political polarization, requiring governance systems to balance long-term sustainability with economic priorities and social stability.

Social activism by citizens in national and local communities will continue to influence political landscapes, challenging current governance systems in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, activists have pushed for trans- parency, social reforms, and policies on justice, equality, and human rights.60 They have also encouraged more political in- volvement, leading to a more informed public. However, ac- tivism has also led to greater polarization61, making it harder for governments to agree on policies. Overall, social activism can make governance more accountable and responsive to the people, but it also brings challenges that need to be care- fully addressed by both activists and leaders.

## Rise of Non-State and Sub-National Actors

Non-state actors and local governments have become in- creasingly important in shaping governance, particularly as global and local challenges evolve. Issues like growing cli- mate change, increasing informal sector and inequality, and widening digital divides are highlighting the need for more localized, tailored approaches to resource distribution and management coupled with effective multilevel governance and strong multilateralism.62

## Growing Influence of Non-state Actors

Non-state actors (NSAs) include a wide range of entities such as multinational corporations, civil society organiza- tions (NGOs), advocacy groups, religious institutions, and even armed non-state groups. They can have a profound im- pact on governance across various levels-local, national, and international, shaping policy, public opinion, and even the enforcement of laws and regulations.

Large multinational corporations are increasingly influencing political decisions and elections, challenging the traditional functions of international and national institutions. Due to their economic size and transnational reach, they can wield significant power to shape laws and regulations, sometimes bypassing or outpacing national governments in influence. NGOs can fill governance gaps in areas where governments may be weak, such as providing humanitarian assistance during crises, or offering health, education, and infrastruc- ture services in underdeveloped regions. In countries with weak governance structures, NGOs may become vital for survival and development. Grassroots movements and activ- ists are becoming more instrumental in rallying public sup- port for political change (e.g., civil rights movements or cli- mate change protests), thereby influencing policy changes and, social norms, and even challenging state legitimacy. Armed non-state actors, such as insurgent groups or crim- inal and terrorist organizations, can disrupt governance by leveraging technology to escalate security threats, creating instability, weakening state authority, challenging existing political systems, and even establishing alternative govern- ance structures.

## Importance of Local Governments

There is a growing shift from national to local governance, driven by increasing urbanization and the realization that decisions affecting most people are often made at the lo- cal level. Local governments worldwide are increasingly

confronted with complex, multidimensional challenges that must be addressed in a coordinated way to promote sustain- able development. This is especially true in developing coun- tries, where urban areas are expected to grow rapidly.

If current trends continue, by 2050, urban areas will house approximately 70 percent of the world's population and con- tribute to more than 80 percent of global economic output.63 In the developing world, the land occupied by urban areas will triple by 2050, signaling a shift toward urban sprawl similar to that already seen in cities of developed countries.64 Con- sequently, the contributions of subnational governments will be crucial for achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable De- velopment, as local action will be necessary to meet at least 100 of the 169 SDG targets.65

## Role of Emerging-Market Cities in Global Dynamics
A key trend in global governance is the increasing influence of emerging-market cities.66 Cities have become powerful economic hubs, essential nodes in international networks that shape global supply chains, investments, and techno- logical progress.67 They serve as centers of cultural and so- cial influence, as well as drivers of policy innovation. Their growing economic importance is influencing policy agen- das, norms, values, and priorities both at the global and na- tional levels. This presents both challenges and opportuni- ties across governance levels. On the one hand, cities are becoming central to addressing global challenges such as climate change, urban poverty, and cross-border transpor- tation. On the other hand, this growing significance has led to a stronger demand for their inclusion in international fo- rums, challenging the role of the national government. How- ever, many existing international governance structures fail to adequately represent these rising centers of power. These frameworks should recognize cities as crucial stakeholders, especially in tackling issues like climate adaptation, migra- tion, and economic inequality—issues that directly impact ur- ban populations68 and promote more inclusive global govern- ance models.

# IV. FORESIGHT APPROACH: PREPARING FOR FUTURE GOVERNANCE

## Applying Strategic Foresight to Governance: Design and Methodology
To understand possible pathways forward and prepare for governance futures, this policy brief applied strategic fore- sight to explore two distinct governance futures for 2040:

* Baseline Scenarios: A world where governance evolves incrementally, adapting to changes but maintaining tradi- tional hierarchical structures.
* ■ Radical Scenarios: A future where governance under- goes transformational change, embracing AI-augment- ed democracy, decentralized power, and dynamic citizen participation.

These scenarios provide a framework for decision-mak- ers to anticipate risks, seize opportunities, and design gov- ernance systems that are resilient, inclusive, and better equipped for the future. The strategic foresight exercise to explore and assess potential governance futures was under- taken by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), in collaboration with the UN Fu- tures Lab/Global Hub.69

The exercise examined key drivers of change70 across the political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legislative (PESTLE) 71 domains and explored potential gov- ernance scenarios. To identify the top drivers of change, UN DESA designed an online survey72 based on prior research conducted for this policy brief and administered it to 23 UN agencies. It also developed several analytical tools to fa- cilitate exploratory data analysis of the survey responses. These tools included an interactive dashboard73, a network analysis, and an AI assistant (see Figure 4).

The survey results were then presented in a Foresight Webi- nar Series74 as the basis to explore the following:

1. What could governance at the global, national, and local levels look like in 2040 and beyond?
2. How could key drivers of change—such as technological advancements or shifts in political systems—influence governance structures?
3. What alternative or innovative governance models could emerge to address global challenges, such as climate change, inequality, cybersecurity, and future pandemics?

To help answer these three key questions, a range of foresight methodologies and tools were used throughout the Foresight Webinar Series, including horizon scanning, scenario devel- opment, desired future, and change agenda. Using the sur- vey results, a horizon scanning exercise was conducted during the first session to assess the current state of governance at global, national, and local levels considering emerging trends. The top drivers of change identified across the PESTLE do- mains affecting governance at all levels are shown in Figure 2.

The network analysis identified interlinkages among the driv- ers of change, revealing interconnected challenges and op- portunities. Recognizing these relationships is crucial for de- signing flexible, adaptive governance systems capable of managing future uncertainties and interconnected issues (see Figure 3).

Using insights from the network analysis and the Al assis- tant75, the most salient cross-cutting issues were identified

## Figure 4

Results from the Survey: Exploring Governance Futures with the UN Economist Network and UN Futures Lab

User: for those who chose climate change as a major driver of change what were their views on economic drivers?

AI: Those who selected climate change as a key driver ofther emphasized the need for green and sustainable economies (Sustainability Imperatives and Shift). They recognized that transitioning to a low-carbon future would require significant economic shifts, affecting industries, labor markets, and global trade patterns. This interconnection highlights the importance of aligning economic policies with climate goals to ensure a just and equitable transition. For example, investing in green technologies and renewable energy could create new jobs, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and foster innovation, while also mitigating climate change.

User: give and example of a respondent who chose climate change as a driver of change and talk about their other choices.

AI: One respondent, a woman from Guatemala working for the UN, selected climate change as an existential threat, alongside resource depletion and competition for resources. This choice reflects the interconnected nature of these drivers. Climate change is exacerbating resource scarcity, driving conflict and migration. Her additional choices—growing inequality— further emphasize how interconnected global challenges are, highlighting the need for future governance to address these issues holistically.

as potential major forces of change, including geopolitical dynamics, technological advances, shifts in social behav- ior, and the rise of non-state actors (see Table 1). These find- ings were further refined through an analytical review of nar- ratives, clustering, and sensemaking to ensure contextual grounding, integration of key nuances from responses, and applicability to each stage of the strategic foresight process. The thematic areas were used to develop potential govern- ance scenarios toward 2040 and explore possible govern- ance models for addressing global challenges. They were also used for the visioning and action planning based on baseline (status quo) and radical scenarios.

# V. GOVERNANCE FUTURES SCENARIOS

The foresight exercise conducted during the Foresight Webi- nar Series explored the implications of the interplay between different drivers under the four major forces of change elabo- rated in the previous section. Participants imagined how gov- ernance could look like in 2040 when examined through the lenses of each cross-cutting issue.

Eight potential future governance scenarios were devel- oped, two per cross-cutting issues: a baseline (status quo/ no change) scenario and a radical scenario (major structural transformation resulting from revolutionary responses), re- spectively, as detailed below. These scenarios provide in- sights into both positive and negative outcomes that can either foster governance innovation or exacerbate current instability.

## Baseline Future Scenarios—Slow Changes to the Status Quo

These scenarios depict slow or insufficient responses to global challenges, leading to governance stagnation or fragmentation.

## 1. Geopolitical Dynamics: Minimal Multilateralism in a Fragmented World

In this scenario, the global landscape could shift towards a multipolar system, with several powerful countries or re- gions that compete for influence. Countries and regions with robust economies or technological power would gain more influence on the global stage challenging existing hi- erarchies. Regionalized governance and collaboration might flourish in areas like climate change or trade, reducing the dominance of global institutions but creating a more coop- erative, albeit fragmented, world. Large multinational tech companies could gain unprecedented power, especially in sectors like AI, biotech, and digital infrastructure. These cor- porations could exert more influence than some states in terms of economic or technological policy.

As multilateral cooperation diminishes and the world be- comes more fragmented, the ability to address global threats like pandemics or cyber warfare could be signifi- cantly hampered. However, new governance structures could emerge tailored to specific issues or geographical areas. For example, regional bodies might take on greater respon- sibility for managing climate adaptation, migration, or trade agreements, while global institutions take a backseat in some areas. This could lead to greater cooperation between countries with shared interests, but at the cost of global co- ordination. In this dynamic and evolving world, maintaining stability and ensuring global cooperation in addressing criti- cal challenges will be increasingly difficult.

## 2. Technological Advancements: Digital Governance with Persistent Inequalities

This scenario portrays a world where digital governance has brought significant advancements in efficiency, transpar- ency, and inclusivity but also introduces critical challenges. Governments face the dilemma of managing the opportuni- ties of digital transformation while addressing the risks of digital exclusion, cybersecurity threats, and corporate influ- ence. As these technologies evolve, there is a pressing need for adaptive regulatory frameworks, cybersecurity measures, and strategies to bridge the digital divides. Gaps between technologically advanced and underdeveloped regions or countries may deepen, potentially leading to a global dig- ital divide that limits opportunities for those already disad- vantaged and create new power imbalances. The key will be balancing innovation with oversight to ensure digital govern- ance serves the common good without compromising public trust or widening global inequalities.

## 3. Shifts in Social Behavior: The "Great Withdrawal" and Declining Trust in Institutions

This scenario presents a complex and dynamic landscape where governance systems are significantly weakened by de- clining public trust. In this scenario, the erosion of trust leads to gradual changes in governance. Local governments be- come more central in addressing issues, and there may be increased calls for reforms in multilateral institutions. How- ever, the power of entrenched elites keeps larger systemic change at bay, and social unrest may persist without funda- mentally changing the governance landscape. The future is marked by growing discontent, localized governance experi- ments, and calls for systemic change, yet with significant re- sistance from powerful elites and institutions that maintain their hold on power.

The risk of fragmentation and further societal division re- mains high and finding a balance between maintaining sta- bility and addressing the growing demand for change will be crucial. The challenge will be to find ways to rebuild trust and foster greater collaboration without further fragmenting the social and political landscape. While elites may hold power in the short term, the demand for reform and greater represen- tation from marginalized groups, local governments, and the global South could eventually challenge the status quo. The central tension in this scenario will be between the resilience of established power structures and the need for reforms to address new challenges, which could either recalibrate the system or worsen fragmentation.

## 4. The Rise of Non-State Actors in Governance

In this scenario, the combination of decentralization, digital- ization and the rise of non-state actors might reshape tradi- tional governance structures, emphasizing more localized, participatory, and collaborative approaches. Governance could be characterized by a hybrid model where states main- tain significant power, particularly in international markets, but local and non-state actors increasingly shape political decisions. The traditional state-centric system will give way to a more networked and participatory approach, with col- laboration, decentralization, and digital tools playing central roles in addressing both local and global challenges. How- ever, the balance between state sovereignty and the rising in- fluence of non-state actors will remain a critical challenge, with the potential to create fragmented governance systems and geopolitical tensions. In a world where globalization con- tinues to intertwine economies, politics, and cultures, states will face the challenge of asserting their authority without sti- fling the rise of local and regional movements.

# Overview of Baseline Scenarios-Incremental Change and Limited Adaptation
These scenarios depict slow or insufficient responses to global challenges, leading to governance stagnation or fragmentation.

## 1. Minimal Multilateralism-A Fragmented World
- **The Trend:** Weakening of global institutions (UN, WTO) due to rising nationalism, trade protectionism, and regionalism.
- **The Shift:** Nations form smaller alliances, but weak coordination limits solutions to global crises (climate change, pandemics).
- **A Key Concern:** Without effective multilateralism, cross-border governance challenges will escalate.

## 2. Digital Governance with Persistent Inequalities
- **The Promise:** AI and digital tools enhance efficiency, transparency, and service delivery.
- **The Risk:** Widening digital divides, cybersecurity threats increase, and AI bias impacts policymaking.
- **Key Concern:** Over-reliance on digital systems controlled by tech giants may undermine state authority and inclusivity.

## 3. The "Great Withdrawal"-Declining Trust in Institutions
- **The Challenge:** Rising political disengagement, social polarization, and skepticism toward governments.
- **The Impact:** Social media activism replaces institutional engagement, but no major governance reforms occur.
- **Key Concern:** If institutions fail to regain trust, local governments may take on more governance roles, leading to fragmentation.

## 4. The Rise of Non-State Actors in Governance
- **The Shift:** Cities, multinational corporations, and NGOs step in where national governments fall short.
- **The Balance:** Local solutions grow stronger, but policy coordination and accountability become complex.
- **A Key Concern:** Who regulates non-state actors in a decentralized system?

and stalling multilateral cooperation on issues like climate change and pandemics. Failure to address issues such as climate change, financial imbalances, and trade reforms could disproportionately harm vulnerable regions, such as Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and many developing countries, deepening the divide between the global North and South. The rise of protectionist policies and fragmented governance could prevent the functioning of key international organizations, stalling vital global efforts to address crises and leading to the formation of unstable alliances. This would likely undermine global cooperation and hinder progress on collective challenges. In this scenario, the interplay of political and technological power will likely redefine international cooperation, transforming existing alliances, and altering the power structure between the state and companies. AI will serve as a central driver of both opportunity and conflict.

# Radical Future Scenarios
These scenarios explore governance breakthroughs or systemic breakdowns driven by major disruptions or innovations.

## 1. Geopolitical Dynamics: Al-Driven Global Dystopia vs. Global Governance for Climate Change Solutions
In the Al-Driven Global Dystopia, the concentration of political and technological power could exacerbate authoritarian control, protectionist policies, and a fragmented global economy. This would increase income inequality, political instability, and hinder international collaboration. The growing focus on national security and digital infrastructure could lead to a new form of tech-driven isolationism, where countries prioritize their own interests, further deteriorating trust between nations

In the Global Governance for Climate Change Solutions, the intersection of technological advancements and political power could lead to new forms of cooperation, with countries potentially working together on AI-driven solutions to global challenges, fostering an environment of mutual benefit and shared economic growth. AI could play a pivotal role in combating climate change, utilizing machine learning and data-driven models to offer innovative solutions for managing environmental risks, making the future more sustainable and resilient. Cities and local governments could become hubs of innovation, leveraging AI and green technologies to address pressing challenges such as food security, public health, and climate change. The shift toward local governance could lead to more agile, efficient, and effective solutions that are tailored to specific regional needs.

## 2. Technological Advancements: Al-Driven Authoritarianism or Al augmented Deliberative Democracy
In this scenario, advancements in AI, cloud computing, quantum technologies, and digitalization will revolutionize governance. This transformation could usher in either AI-Augmented Deliberative Democracy or AI-driven Authoritarianism.

In the Al-Driven Authoritarianism, the risks of AI misuse can escalate, especially without proper safeguards in place. This could lead to cybersecurity vulnerabilities; heightened biases, and inequalities, particularly in developing nations; ethical concerns around surveillance, privacy, and data control; power imbalance and digital colonialism where wealthier nations and tech giants exert disproportionate control over global digital infrastructures, undermining smaller countries' sovereignty. Governments will struggle to balance innovation with fairness, social inclusion, and transparency. Creating new regulatory frameworks will be difficult, and there is likely to be resistance to AI governance due to concerns over privacy and democratic values.

## Al-Driven Authoritarianism

## 3. Shifts in Social Behaviors: Chaos or Participatory Renaissance
In this scenario, governance systems may either collapse into chaos or evolve into a participatory renaissance, depending on how societies respond to rising populism, technological disruptions, and social inequalities. In the "Chaos" scenario, governance becomes fragmented or even suffer a break down where disruptive social movements question existing national and global systems and fuel dangerous and polarizing political shifts. This could lead to the rise of extremist ideologies. Technology could exacerbate these tendencies, making governance systems more vulnerable to manipulation and instability. Traditional power structures could collapse, leading to a loss of trust and order, widespread violence and instability.

In the Participatory Renaissance, power is decentralized, and governance is more inclusive. Citizens have a greater role in influencing policies through innovative platforms and grassroots movements, creating new avenues for citizen participation. Local governments gain more influence, fostering greater engagement and collaboration between nations and international bodies. Multilateralism is revived.

## 4. The Rise of Non-State and Subnational Actors: Inclusive Decentralized Governance or Failed States
In this scenario, the role of non-state actors in governance will continue to expand, which could lead to two distinct paths: Decentralized Governance or Failed States. In the Inclusive Decentralized Governance, local governments and grassroots organizations will be empowered and work collaboratively with the state, promoting participatory systems that are more responsive to emerging challenges and citizens' need. Technologies like AI, crowdsourcing, and blockchain will enable transparent and effective governance, ensuring decisions

align with values of inclusion, sustainability, and equity. Governance structures are more inclusive, with local authorities and non-state actors reflecting the diverse needs of communities and ensuring that no one is left behind.

In the Failed State, non-state actors (e.g., transnational criminal organizations, radical militant groups) will exploit state weaknesses, exacerbating regional instability and undermining international cooperation. States struggle to assert the rule of law, and non-state actors use technology to undermine political processes, causing further chaos and governance breakdown. The ability of governments to respond effectively is compromised, leading to increased vulnerability to external pressures and internal conflict. How Governments will be able to leverage the potential of non-state actors and keep at bay criminal organizations will play an important role in shaping the governance of the future.

## Overview of Radical Scenarios-Transformational Change or Disruptive Shifts
### 1. AI-Driven Global Dystopia vs. Global Governance for Climate Solutions
- **A Geopolitical Breakdown:** AI and emerging tech widen inequalities, fuel economic rivalry, and spark cyber conflicts.
- **Sustainable Innovation:** AI-powered tools help mitigate climate change, improving resource management and governance.
- **Key Concern:** Will AI be used to divide or unite nations in tackling global crises, including climate change?

### 2. AI-Augmented Democracy vs. AI-Driven Authoritarianism
- **Optimistic Future:** AI enhances deliberative democracy, enabling real-time policymaking and broader citizen participation.
- **A Dystopian Future:** AI-controlled governance consolidates power of tech giants and status quo political leaders, enabling mass surveillance and algorithmic bias.
- **Key Concern:** How can governments regulate AI to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability?

### 3. Chaos vs. Participatory Renaissance
- **Crisis Scenario:** Institutional failures trigger governance breakdowns, populism surges, and political instability worsens.
- **Reform Scenario:** Civic engagement and grassroots movements drive a new wave of participatory democracy.
- **Key Concern:** Can institutions evolve quickly enough to harness public participation rather than suppress it?

### 4. Inclusive Decentralized Governance vs. Failed States
- **Local Power Shift:** Cities and regions gain importance, using technology and grassroots networks.
- **A Authoritarian Response:** National Governments restrict freedoms and consolidate power to maintain control.
- **Key Concern:** Can decentralized governance scale up effectively without losing multi-level governance coherence and accountability?

## Overview of Baseline and Radical Future Scenarios

| | Geopolitical dynamics | Technological advancements | Shifts in social behavior | Non-state and local actors |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Baseline** | ● Minimal multilateralism | ● Digital governance with inequalities | ● "Great withdrawal" (declining trust) | ● Fragmented governance systems |
| **Negative** | | ■ AI-driven authoritarianism | ■ Chaos and collapse | ■ Failed state autocratic power |
| **Radical** | ■ AI-driven dystopia | | | |
| **Positive** | ■ Climate cooperation | ■ AI-augmented democracy | ■ Participatory renaissance | ■ Inclusive decentralized governance |

# VI. KEY VALUES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF A DESIRABLE FUTURE

GOVERNANCE FUTURES: KEY INSIGHTS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS

***

- **Decentralization and Local Empowerment:** Advocating for governance at the appropriate level, empowering local actors while addressing global challenges.
- **Addressing Urban-Rural Divide:** As megacities continue to grow, rural and smaller urban areas must be given more representation and access to resources to avoid further marginalization.
- **Respect for Diverse Perspectives and Local Cultures:** Future governance systems must balance global coordination with respect for local contexts, cultures, and traditions, by recognizing diverse perspectives, including those of marginalized groups, Indigenous knowledge, and alternative systems of thought.

These values and principles reflect a collective aspiration for governance systems that are ethical, people-centered, and resilient in addressing contemporary and future challenges.

# VII. PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR KEY STAKEHOLDERS
The possible future scenarios explored during the foresight exercise and visioning of key values and characteristics of potential preferred governance futures provided a framework to understand what needs to happen now and what different actors—United Nations system, UN Member States, and Non-State Actors—should do to achieve those futures. The proposed pathways for action for the different actors are inspired by a combination of the governance models listed below that are considered the most promising to generate the necessary structural, institutional, regulatory, and behavioral changes that need to happen. These models can help balance the power of technology with democratic values, human rights, and global cooperation.

**AI-Augmented Deliberative Democracy:** where principles of deliberative democracy and artificial intelligence (AI) are merged to enhance democratic processes through decentralized decision-making. AI tools are incorporated into deliberative processes to facilitate, enhance and expand democratic participation. Ensuring AI and internet access and strong regulatory frameworks will be critical to ensure inclusion, ethical safeguards, prevent misinformation and AI algorithm biases, and consider all viewpoints.

**Participatory Renaissance:** where citizens play an active role in decision-making processes through collaborative governance networks of citizens and non-state actors in shaping policies, fostering collective responsibility and shared governance. In this model, elected authorities are empowered and resourced to drive transformation. AI plays a key role in facilitating deliberative democracy. Data privacy and effective platform governance will be critical to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in the algorithms driving decision-making.

**Decentralized Governance:** where local governments are central actors in addressing local issues and collaborate with each other and with national and international entities to tackle global challenges. AI and other advanced technologies play a key role in enhancing participation and efficiency at all levels of governance. Access to digital tools and robust regulatory frameworks will be critical to ensure inclusive participation and protect against criminal exploitation, resource mismanagement, and data privacy violation.

# UN Support in Building Foresight Capacities for Anticipatory Governance
The findings of the foresight exercise, which engaged representatives of 23 UN agencies, exemplify the relevance and usefulness of preparing for the future by understanding current drivers of change and their interlinkages, visioning and future governance scenarios. This methodology can be used at national and local levels of government through multi-stakeholder participation. In this regard, the UN can play a pivotal role in fostering the use of foresight to develop national strategies and plans to achieve the SDGs, leveraging its existing expertise, structures, and partnerships. It can support UN Member States develop capacities for foresight at the individual level (developing foresight mindsets), and at the organizational and institutional levels. It can do so in multiple ways as illustrated below⁷⁶.

## 1. Provide Advisory Services for:
- Integration of systems thinking and strategic foresight into governance structures, including through the creation of new foresight institutional arrangements such national foresight units or departments that can carry out horizon scanning, risk analysis, and long-term planning.
- Designing/redesigning national policies and strategies for systems thinking and strategic foresight that promote policy coherence and integrated planning to achieve internationally agreed development goals, including the SDGs and/or other relevant international agreements.
- Incorporating systems thinking and strategic foresight into national development planning and implementation processes, aligning them with financing strategies
- Promoting transformational change by cultivating a foresight and experimental organizational culture to design coherent policies in the public sector.
- Enabling a shift in mindset towards systems thinking, strategic planning, foresight, and agility to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other international agreements.

## 2. Foresight Training of Trainers and Training Programs
The UN can develop and implement targeted foresight training programs for governments, and other stakeholders, tailored to different regions and contexts, considering local needs and challenges through:

76 Many of these efforts are underway by the UN Futures Lab/Global Hub, which was established in 2023 by the Executive Office of the Secretary-General to help drive the integration of futures thinking and strategic foresight in planning, policymaking, and decision-making. For more information, see www.un-futureslab.org. UN DESA provides capacity development support to Member States, upon their request, in the area of strategic foresight and systems thinking.

### VIII. CONCLUSION

Governance is at an inflection point. Institutions designed for 20th-century challenges now struggle to adapt to 21st-century disruptions. As technological acceleration, geopolitical instability, and citizen disillusionment reshape global, national, and local governance, the need for transformation has never been more urgent. In an era of rapid change, strategic foresight is critical. It empowers policymakers to anticipate disruptions, mitigate risks, and design governance models that are adaptive, inclusive, and future-ready. The scenarios presented in this policy brief highlight the stakes of inaction and the opportunities of foresight-driven decision-making. The UN is uniquely positioned to promote foresight on a global scale. By providing targeted training, facilitating global knowledge exchange, and leveraging its research capabilities, the UN can build strong foundations for foresight and strategic planning across nations to enable countries to anticipate future challenges, mitigate risks, and capitalize on emerging opportunities for sustainable development.
