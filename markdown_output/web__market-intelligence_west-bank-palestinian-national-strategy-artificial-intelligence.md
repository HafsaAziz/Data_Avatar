# West Bank: Palestinian National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence

Developing a National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy in the West Bank is at the core of the Palestinian Government’s process of implementing digital transformation in the government sector.  An AI strategy is crucial for supporting sustainable development, facilitating regional cooperation, and positioning the West Bank as an international player in the field of AI.

In 2021, the Palestinian Council of Ministers formed a national team for AI with the responsibilities to define, implement, and manage the National AI Strategy.  The team was headed by the Ministry of Telecommunications and Digital Economy and included representatives from government ministries and councils, academia, and the private sector.  As a result, a National Artificial Intelligence Strategy was launched in 2023.  The strategy outlines the Palestinian Government’s plans to enhance the use of AI technologies to transform the economy, harness the technology, develop appropriate business models, and implement major changes to create growth.

The Strategy’s objectives:

The Strategy’s Action Areas:

The Palestinian Authority has taken actions to institutionalize AI technologies by creating strategies, governance bodies, legal and ethical draft laws, and some pilot programs in education and data infrastructure.  These actions are still in the early stage.  There are many challenges in implementation, scaling, and technical capacity.

In education, the Arab American University and Birzeit University in the West Bank are integrating AI into curricula and have recently launched graduate and undergraduate specializations in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.  Other educational programs include the Palestinian Information Technology Association’s (PITA) capacity building and training programs on integrating AI and machine learning in the private tech sector.

Good opportunities exist for U.S. companies that specialize in AI solutions and applications in the transportation, energy, agriculture, environment, water, tourism, and healthcare sectors.  Future demand is expected for U.S. companies specializing in data storage, cloud computing, servers, and cybersecurity. Doing business with tech companies in the West Bank offers access to a growing pool of young, well-educated talent in areas like software development and data science.
