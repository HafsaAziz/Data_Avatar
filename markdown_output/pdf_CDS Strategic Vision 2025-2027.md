# Message from our Chief Executive Officer

[Image of Paul N. Wagner. Caption: Source: Paul Wagner]

> "Canadians deserve high-quality and efficient Government services that are accessible, timely, and make their lives easier."

**Paul N. Wagner,**
CEO, Canadian Digital Service

In 2018, Canada's Economic Strategy Tables issued a challenge to the Government of Canada to "Digitize all public-facing government services so they are accessible by web and mobile phone and available behind a unified login system by 2025." The first Canadian Digital Service Strategy was born out of this challenge in May 2019, and it is one that continues to drive the relevance and evolution of the organization today.

As we celebrate five years since the publication of our first strategy, we are reflecting on our achievements, building on our experience and evolving toward an enterprise-class CDS. As we look back, we have a lot to celebrate. During the unprecedented pressures government faced because of the COVID-19 pandemic, CDS rose to the challenge. The principles of being human centered, working iteratively and in the open allowed the organization to deliver where others couldn't. With already established multidisciplinary agile product teams, the use of GC Notify, a CDS home-grown product for sending notifications, was expanded to ensure that important information about the pandemic was reaching Canadians in a timely manner. In addition, many CDS employees quickly pivoted to the development of COVID Alert: Canada's exposure notification app to help limit the spread of the disease by increasing people's awareness of their potential exposure. The organization's ability to respond during this moment of crisis demonstrated its value and saw CDS gain permanent funding and an expanded mandate to deliver services on behalf of other government jurisdictions.

The pandemic demonstrated how important it is for government to adopt modern technological infrastructure and empower agile teams to respond and improve services at speed. As the country emerged from pandemic restrictions, it

also pushed us to reflect on long-standing service delivery problems that became front page news when backlogs in the processing of passports and immigration applications gained widespread coverage in the press and on social media.

The start-up days of CDS are coming to an end. In the seven years since the organization was launched as a pilot, so much has happened, and a lot of progress has been made toward digital service delivery in the Government of Canada. But, when we think about all the possibilities and the potential for what end-to-end digital service delivery could look like (see Annex 1), we recognize that more still needs to be done. CDS is evolving as an organization, and we are ready to respond to the challenge.

I became the CEO of CDS in November 2023. I accepted this new challenge at a moment when conversations around improving the delivery of government services were steadily gaining momentum. The summer of 2023 saw the culmination of work by the ministerial task force to improve government services to Canadians, followed by the establishment of a new Minister of Citizens' Services and an Order in Council that brought CDS to Service Canada. With the move to the new department, CDS was given an expanded mandate to enable digital service improvements across the Government of Canada, ushering in a new era for the organization.

When the ministerial task force to improve services to Canadians was launched, the explanation of its impetus began with a simple statement, “Canadians deserve high-quality and efficient government services that are accessible, timely, and make their lives easier.” Much like the challenge issued by the Canadian Digital Strategy Tables in 2018, these words truly resonate with me and are a launching point for our current strategic vision.

As I look back on my first six months at CDS, I feel privileged to be part of such an amazing organization with one of the best mandates in the Government of Canada. I am looking at the future with a great deal of hope for what we can accomplish. It's time to take stock of what we have done, live by the lessons that we have learned, and set our sights toward new challenges. Drawing on key findings and recommendations from the formative evaluation of CDS and a third-party viability review completed by Deloitte, this strategy lays out a refreshed mandate for CDS and a roadmap for collaboration across government to improve the end-to-end service journey through digital enablement.

I would like all public servants to see this as an invitation and a call to action to break down silos and embark on this important journey with us. As the Government of Canada, we can only deliver digital services that meet people's expectations if we do it together.

**Paul N. Wagner**

# How we got here

[Logo: CDS SNC Canada]

Founded in 2017 as a three-year pilot project, CDS aimed to fundamentally change the way federal government services are designed and delivered. Partnering with federal departments and enabling public servants to adopt evidence based and iterative methods of working was the mainstay of CDS's early business model. After demonstrating impact and potential, funding for the CDS pilot was extended in 2019 by two additional years.

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 prompted a doubling of the CDS budget, reflecting the urgent need for enhanced digital services. In 2021, funding for CDS became permanent, solidifying the presence of the organization as a driver of change in the federal government. CDS also gained the authority to provide digital platform services to other levels of government paving the way for more interjurisdictional collaboration.

In July 2023, as part of the broader push by the Government of Canada to improve service delivery, a new Minister of Citizens’ Services was appointed. Shortly after, CDS was moved to Service Canada within Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) through an Order in Council. This move aimed to increase the impact of CDS in helping to deliver on a cohesive vision for government services and marks a significant turning point in how service transformation is being framed and driven within the Government of Canada.

Capacity and expertise are being brought together in recognition of the need for a whole-of-government approach to accelerate service transformation. After welcoming Paul N. Wagner, the new CEO in November 2023, CDS’s position as a leader in GC transformation was further solidified when responsibility for digital credentials and client experience were transferred to the organization shortly after. Previously, no department has had the mandate to connect the dots to understand the impact of siloed service delivery across the Government of Canada.

Canadian Digital Service | Strategic vision 2024-2027

***

With the new Minister of Citizens’ Services, this role is now being assumed by Service Canada. CDS holds domain expertise that will make it an integral player in charting a strategic path forward for how government services are designed and enabled by research, data, and technology. The tools and talent to accelerate service improvements will be more accessible through easy-to-implement product solutions and capacity building services. CDS will lead the way in conducting strategic research and analysis of existing government data related to digital and service. Through collaboration with key partners, such as TBS, CDS will provide advice and recommendations to guide senior leaders and governance tables in making better decisions around application rationalization, service consolidation and client experience. It will also dramatically increase the GC’s ability to funnel investments toward enterprise solutions to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and reach of government services.

As the organization positions itself to scale its products and the scope of its services, a key area of focus for CDS will continue to be improving services delivered by Service Canada, as an anchor client. Headway has already been made toward establishing an integrated service experience and providing easier access to information and Service Canada benefits through Customer experience (CX) capacity building, leveraging the GC Design System, and by having embedded product delivery teams throughout the department on priority service improvement initiatives. CDS, with the leadership of the department’s new Chief Client Experience Officer, will play a key role in driving client centered improvements within Service Canada.

In addition to working with Service Canada, CDS recognizes the important work that is already underway in other key service delivery departments, including Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada, Canada Revenue Agency, and Innovation, Science and Economic Development. CDS will act as a uniting force to further enable ongoing service modernization initiatives through existing and new CDS products, including a single front door for accessing government services for which funding was provided in Budget 2024.

CDS is perfectly poised to become the digital service transformation enabler for the federal Government.

In turn, CDS will leverage the success of ongoing work to accelerate the transformation of services in other areas where solutions can be reused and scaled. In addition, within Service Canada, CDS will take on a new leadership role in providing a target state operating model and standards for client experience and service delivery. While TBS has clearly outlined what government needs to achieve through the Policy on Service and Digital, CDS is helping departments understand how to get there. In assuming an advisory and leadership function, CDS will further increase the impact of digital service improvement efforts through prioritization of transformation initiatives and alignment of existing and new investments at the enterprise level. CDS is perfectly poised to become the digital service transformation enabler for the federal government.

# The way CDS works positions us all for success

CDS works differently and this has been a huge contributor to our success. Whether we are building products, working to solve service problems in other departments or tracking down evidence to help the GC make strategic transformation decisions, we work according to a common set of values:

We work in small, empowered, independent, interdisciplinary teams

We engage directly with the people who will use the service, at every stage

We make small, incremental changes to products, continuously

We make accessible, inclusive services that work on any device or screen

</> We make it easier for other departments to work in similar ways by sharing code, resources, work-in-progress, community, and lessons

We advocate for and inform policy changes, grounded in delivery experience

We work together by following the CDS Values and the Values & Ethics of the Public Service

7
Canadian Digital Service | Strategic vision 2024-2027

***

# CDS is distributed across Canada to tap into digital talent pools, and uses a talent sourcing strategy to ensure that we can compete with the private sector.

Members of the organization come with diverse experiences and backgrounds. As an organization that works tirelessly to design and develop products and services that are equitable and accessible, CDS will maintain and look to expand its footprint across the country and work to ensure that the team is representative of all people that the Government of Canada serves.

Our delivery teams are multidisciplinary by default and are comprised of members with different skill sets: a product manager, a service owner, a delivery manager, a user researcher, a content designer, a designer, and a developer. These teams can also draw upon the expertise of policy advisors, storytellers, and localizers. To maintain their focus, CDS takes the pressure off delivery teams by removing blockers and administrative burden through the provision of in-house infrastructure and operations support. CDS also pushes the boundaries in areas that have been traditionally problematic in the service transformation space. When it was established, CDS identified and then created the conditions that it would need to succeed.

By seeking authorities to operate a little differently, CDS has made it possible to experiment while pathfinding modern digital government delivery through:

*   A unique CDS brand identifier for marketing, communications, and recruitment
*   Flexibility to use and procure the technology and tools that optimize employee productivity while allowing the organization to explore innovative methods of securely developing and delivering products
*   Hiring across Canada and maintaining a full-time distributed and remote work environment
*   Human resources (HR) flexibility to recruit and hire highly sought-after talent
*   ‘Working in the open’, which means acknowledging the nature of our work as being iterative and broadly sharing our failures and successes, so our learning is collective

CDS isn’t run like a typical government department, it has been intentionally designed to enable agile multidisciplinary teams to deliver products and services.

# What CDS brings to the table

## A vision for a digitally enabled end-to-end service journey and the products and services to get there.

As a product delivery organization and a digital service delivery enabler for the GC, CDS has a lot to offer. Over the next three years we will be on a journey to increase the use of our existing products and services and introduce new ones strategically to enable an improved end-to-end digital service experience. CDS has distilled government client experiences into six common stages.

Below we have outlined what an optimal digitally enabled experience could look like from the perspective of a client if services were integrated across channels:

**Awareness and learning about programs**
People are made aware of the program, can understand eligibility, and learn how to apply

**Application and providing requirements**
Integrated digital services provide an experience that meets modern expectations

**Waiting to hear back from government**
The stress of waiting is reduced through clear communication of updates on progress

**Meeting additional requirements**
Complicated or multi-step journeys are supported with channel integration

**Getting a decision and/or appeals**
Decisions are communicated in a timely and appropriate way. Appeals are supported so people aren’t starting over

**Receiving benefits, enrollment, or updates**
Getting a benefit, proof, or deposit is fast. Updating or withdrawing later is easy and integrated

Annex 1 of this document provides additional details on CDS's vision for how the government's current siloed service channels could be better integrated. Through digital technologies, in person, and call centre support, key digital products and back-office service operations are depicted in a future state as all working together to better meet the needs and expectations of clients.

Currently, CDS is contributing to digital enablement of services through existing composable products like GC Notify and GC Forms. They offer easily integrated solutions to improve access to services and have the potential to gain efficiencies through widespread (re)use across the GC. Our evidence-based GC Design System is continuously helping government move towards a consistent and user-friendly web and mobile experience and is improving through regular user testing. As a delivery organization we also know what it takes to adopt new methods of working and will continue to grow government's capacity to work with a digital mindset by providing expert advice and services across the GC. As we have in the past, we will continue to offer hands-on advisory and capacity building services to help departments along their transformation journeys, evolving our offerings based on areas of need.

Moving from TBS to Service Canada and taking on a larger scope of work means that CDS will be going through a time of transition. We will be working toward a new business model that will draw on our previous success, while at the same time exploring new territory through the introduction of whole-of-government enterprise products to solve common service problems. This approach will allow us to move the needle on solving enterprise service problems at the same time as supporting departmental service outcomes. Times of transition can be unsettling, but driving innovation at scale is what CDS was meant to do.

# Staying mission oriented during transition and growth

Over the next three years, CDS will do a lot of work to grow into an enterprise leading organization with the capacity to steer and support digital enablement at the whole-of-government level. While sticking to our values, we will be building on our experience and a strong foundation to deliver on a new and ambitious mandate.

To enable a better end-to-end service journey for people and businesses seeking services from the Government of Canada, we will maintain our focus on four key missions. These missions are guided by the Government of Canada’s Digital Ambition and the Mandate Letter of the Minister of Citizens’ Services. At the same time they also provide a framework for showing what it looks like to deliver using Canada’s Digital Standards.

## Mission 1
**Easy access to government services for all people and businesses**

The needs of all clients are proactively taken into consideration to increase ease of access to information and services and minimize the number of touchpoints required to obtain a service.

**At a whole-of-government level this mission will be accomplished by:**

- Offering multiple channels for accessing services that accommodate varying user preferences and accessibility needs
- Consolidating access to various government services in one place through a single front door. This includes an enterprise solution for signing in and verifying identity
- Ensuring that clients can choose to share data between services to reduce the need to provide the same information and documents multiple times

## Mission 2
**Human centered client experiences focused on solving whole problems**

Service journeys that may span multiple departments are organized to hide the complexity of government and aim to help clients solve problems holistically in as few steps as possible.

**At a whole-of-government level this mission will be accomplished by:**

- Adopting a client mindset to solving problems stemming from significant milestones, such as having a baby, applying for permanent residency, or incorporating a business
- Strategically reorganizing and linking information and services around life events and proactively exposing additional relevant services and information to clients based on previous interactions
- Providing clients with a service dashboard to track the status of service interactions and be notified of changes

# Transformation capacity building services

These services take shape based on departmental needs. CDS will provide services and tools that focus on but are not limited to, needs and readiness assessments for onboarding to GC products, CX services and advice focused on capacity building in the areas of client research, client testing, performance measurement, and pay-per-use services, including usability testing and research participant recruitment.

Our initial focus will be on improving the delivery of high-volume and high-traffic Service Canada benefit programs through the ongoing involvement of CDS client experience experts working with the Chief Client Experience Officer.

Over time, CDS will drive digital maturity across government by standardizing products across departments that solve common problems and by increasing its ability to make decisions that are informed by data and user research. Better decisions will be made at every step of the policy to service continuum increasing consistency, efficiency, and effectiveness across all service touchpoints where the Government of Canada and clients interact.

# 2024-2027: Reviewing our business model and how we work

With the move to Service Canada and a new and ambitious mandate, CDS will be transforming as an organization with a view to understanding and preserving what worked in the past and a willingness to change how we operate to achieve greater impact on behalf of Canadians.

As an organization that holds being people-centered as one of our values, CDS will develop and launch a change management plan to help our people and our GC customers navigate our strategic transformation. A key element to our success will be strategically positioning the organization within the GC digital ecosystem to support and accelerate digital enablement. This means looking inward and committing to making changes to the way we work. This will include:

- Launching a portfolio management function to build relationships with government departments to understand and prioritize digital enablement needs to improve end-to-end service delivery
- Developing and launching the CDSNext business model, including performance indicators and measures to help with continuous improvement
- Refresh the CDS Brand to include all product and service streams
- Show transparency in our work by working in the open

CDS will take a leadership role at existing and new federal governance tables by working in the open and bringing evidence and data-backed recommendations to establish a vision and a roadmap for a seamless Government of Canada client experience that includes a technology enabled and integrated service channels.

> A common thread as we move through these accomplishments over the next three years will be reporting on our progress, sharing our lessons, and celebrating our collective successes.

This will involve the broad recognition and celebration of our collective successes, and more importantly the acknowledgement of opportunities and lessons identified because of our failures. CDS will make use of existing channels, including the CDS website and blog to showcase these stories. To increase proactive discussion among senior leadership, quarterly updates will be brought to governance tables related to service and digital.

Additionally, CDS is committed to working with provincial partners to drive forward a more connected and inclusive digital future for the nation outlined in **Canada's Digital Ambition 2023**.

Partnerships will also extend to collaborating with international governments and working with like-minded organizations that can help CDS deliver its mandate. Working with not-for-profit organizations, academia, and organizations representing traditionally underserved communities will make it possible for CDS to chart a path forward for federal government services that are innovative, equitable, and inclusive from end-to-end.

A common thread as we move through these accomplishments over the next three years will be reporting on our progress, sharing our lessons, and celebrating our collective successes.
