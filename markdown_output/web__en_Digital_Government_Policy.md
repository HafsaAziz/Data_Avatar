The Digital Government Policy sets the overall direction to achieve sustainable longterm government digital transformation in the Kingdom. The Digital Government Policy supports the development of government entities' strategic plans that are fully aligned with the National Digital Government Strategy. It also supports the implementation of such plans.

The Digital Government Policy sets the overall direction to achieve sustainable longterm government digital transformation in the Kingdom. The Digital Government Policy supports the development of government entities' strategic plans that are fully aligned with the National Digital Government Strategy. It also supports the implementation of such plans.

The Council of Ministers Resolution No. 418 that established the Digital Government Authority (“DGA”), issued on 25-7-1442 AH states that “DGA is the competent and national referent for all issues related to digital government. DGA aims to regulate digital government activities within government entities and thus propel a dynamic digital government environment capable of delivering highly efficient digital services, while promoting digital government integration among all public entities.” Under article 4 of the Resolution, DGA is mandated to issue digital government policies, as well as developing plans, programs, indicators, and measurements related to digital government.

The Digital Government Policies, Standards and Guidelines Framework (referred to as “the Framework”) was created to guide the Kingdom’s public sector towards advanced digital maturity. The Framework (Figure 1) organizes the rules that apply to all government entities digital activities. The Framework is based on the analysis of international best practices distilled to identify the key elements required for the strategic design and implementation of digital government. The Framework contains Policies, Standards and Guidelines that all government entities should use, thus being a critical referent for digital government implementation in the public.

The Digital Government Policy sets the overall direction to achieve sustainable long term government digital transformation in the Kingdom. The Digital Government Policy supports the development of government entities strategic plans that are fully aligned with the National Digital Government Strategy. It also supports the implementation of such plans. Five specialized policies, derived from the Digital Government Policy, cover critical digital government areas: governance; digital services management; augmenting beneficiaries’ engagement; developing the necessary human capabilities; and adopting modern technologies and methodologies. The DGA leads the Digital Government Policy implementation by developing and publishing standards and procedures, supporting their adoption across government, and monitoring compliance while collaborating closely with all relevant government entities. That ensures the alignment of digital government across sectors, increases efficiency and optimizes the use of technical resources and investments, all contributing to achieving the Kingdom’s Vision 2030.

The Digital Government Policy comprises four pillars, as follows:



Core principles under each pillar are shown in Figure 2:

Government entities shall build a capable and empowered technical workforce to ensure the successful adoption of digital transformation.
