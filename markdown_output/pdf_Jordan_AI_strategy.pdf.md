# The Economic and Social Impact of the Application of Artificial Intelligence

The application of artificial intelligence technology promotes economic growth through the development of new business models that improve the performance of institutions in the public and private sectors and increase their productivity, which positively affects their competitiveness, increases their chances of entering new markets, and improves their ability to absorb economic fluctuations.

The introduction of artificial intelligence represents a key factor leading to the solution of important national problems, such as. : the problem of unemployment and narrowing the gap between the rich and poor segments of society, which requires the government to reorder its priorities and focus its efforts to obtain external support for investment in the field of artificial intelligence, which in turn highlights Jordan's role in regional competition and improves its rank in international reports, as Jordan is ranked 80th out of 160 countries in the global index of government readiness in the field of artificial intelligence "Oxford Index" for the year 2021, with a rate of 44.38%.

There is no doubt that artificial intelligence applications play an important role in increasing production and reducing its cost, as a 2018 study by McKinsey Global Research Institute showed that artificial intelligence is expected to add about $13 trillion to the global economy, as it contributes to overall production by about 1. A 2016 report by Accenture projects that the use of artificial intelligence technologies will double the economic growth of many developed countries by 2035, with most gains coming in healthcare services, financial markets, retail, and transportation services.

# 6.0 Data

The strategy of artificial intelligence is closely related to data, as data is an important and indispensable component in the search, development and implementation of solutions based on artificial intelligence, as governmental and non-governmental data is considered a valuable economic asset that opens new horizons to complement the national economy with new investments, improve government performance and reduce government spending by using data processing and analysis techniques and deriving insights from them in an accelerated manner.

The importance of data analytics has become apparent with the proliferation of Big Data in various forms and the need to analyze and derive insights from it. Data analytics techniques have evolved rapidly in recent times, especially with the maturity of business intelligence techniques and the expansion of the use of artificial intelligence to enable advanced analytics, improve data exploration processes of various kinds, and automate various aspects of data management.

These technologies are now capable of providing descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and directional analytics using solutions with different capabilities that can be applied in different domains.

To maximize the benefits of providing and benefiting from data, a secure technical and legal environment must be established to maximize the utility of available data and open channels for reliable data sharing. There is also a need to increase the government sector's knowledge of how to use data as an economic asset to ensure readiness, access, qualification, and accuracy of data, especially raw data, as it is an inflow and source to provide artificial intelligence systems and applications with what is needed to be self-learning and produce effective results that translate reality and provide accurate predictions and recommendations to help decision makers make appropriate decisions.

# 6.0 Data

To achieve this, and in line with the vision of economic modernization 2022-2033, the government aims to establish a public data authority responsible for providing data, facilitating access to it, and supporting decision-making. To embody this trend and enable all sectors to benefit from the potential of national data, and to facilitate their regulatory participation under a clear legal framework that fosters innovation and ensures respect for the privacy and confidentiality of information, an integrated data strategy should be developed that includes the following axes:

*   The first axis: data and the economy: including the search for applications that represent an economic benefit to provide effective services or enable the saving of costs, time and effort in various government activities and procedures.
*   The second axis: Data and Users: This axis provides a legal and practical basis for governing application development and production through a clear definition of data ownership and mechanisms for secure data sharing within the foundations and instructions that increase the transparency and economic value of data.
*   The third axis: data and skills: it represents an important common cornerstone and focuses on the aspect of qualification and provision of competencies and skills required for data applications, with the aim of training public sector cadres to improve performance and increase innovation.
*   The fourth axis: data and digital technology: the fourth axis is the technical cornerstone to equip the various data service systems with the necessary modern communication technology, cloud sources, storage and processing capabilities of Big Data, which form a common basis for achieving the goals of the strategy for artificial intelligence.
