The national policy for artificial intelligence (AI) in Libya serves as a comprehensive framework designed to guide the responsible adoption and integration of AI across various sectors in the country. The purpose of this policy is to leverage the transformative potential of AI to enhance economic and social development while addressing associated ethical and legal challenges. Recognising the rapid advancements in AI technologies and their profound implications, the policy aims to create a balanced approach that maximises benefits while mitigating risks.

This framework outlines Libya’s ambitions to adopt AI in a gradual and inclusive manner, ensuring it is used to foster national development and sustainability. The policy emphasises the importance of aligning AI adoption with global standards, while also incorporating ethical safeguards to prevent potential harm. The scope of the policy extends to all stakeholders, including government bodies, private entities, developers, users, and beneficiaries, ensuring a collaborative and comprehensive approach to managing AI technologies.

The policy serves as a roadmap to encourage the integration of AI into vital sectors, stimulate research and development, and build national capacities to support the country’s transition into a knowledge-based economy. By addressing legal, infrastructural, and ethical dimensions, the policy sets the foundation for Libya to become a key player in the global AI landscape.

Objectives of the policy

The policy also underscores the importance of accountability, fairness, transparency, and privacy in AI applications, ensuring that the technology serves humanity’s best interests without compromising ethical standards.
