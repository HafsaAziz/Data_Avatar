# The unprecedented growth of GenAl presents immense opportunities for economic growth, as well as new implications for policymakers and regulators committed to heightening their need for preparedness

From the cloud to blockchain, a litany of technologies have vied to be frontrunners in revolutionizing the world in the last half decade. However, none have been coronated like Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAl), whose emer-gence has captured the attention of corporations, journal-ists, students, and even governments. Until January 2023, the most used GenAl application, ChatGPT, had signed up 100 million users in less than two months, the fastest growing user-base in history at the time, beating TikTok which took nine months to record similar numbers. And while ChatGPT was subsequently dethroned by Meta's latest social media foray, Threads, which achieved the feat in five days, the emergence of new platforms continues to push GenAl deeper into the mainstream consciousness of internet users worldwide.

Could the adoption of GenAl systems surpass that of social media and the smartphone? We will find out soon enough, but the following quote about the rise of the Internet from a Newsweek article in 1995 should help pare down any dismissive opinions naysayers might have: "The truth is that no online database will replace your daily newspaper, no CD-ROM can take the place of a competent teacher, and no computer network will change how the government works".

As GenAl systems proliferate in areas as varied as government services and business processes to translation services and the news, the fact is becoming clearer than ever: we are witnessing an astonishing and exponential growth of opportunities in innovation, efficiency, and personalized solutions, as the potential of GenAl systems becomes more familiar to the world. But as with the growth of any new paradigm-shifting technology, GenAl's rapid increase also presents policymakers, and in particular national security practitioners, with cause for consideration.

# The Basics of GenAl

AI is a machine's ability to imitate intelligence, often through a learning process. Traditional Al is used by both public and private organizations across industries and geographies. It relies on supervised training to classify and analyze data that it is provided with, and responds to specific inputs by detecting patterns, making conclusions, and predicting outcomes accurately. This technology can perform a variety of actions based on input data, including advising the decision-making processes or controlling robots.

On the other hand, where traditional Al classifies existing data, GenAl generates new content creatively. Because it is trained on data of various formats and employs Al algorithms capable of detecting complex patterns, it can generate new outputs while unsupervised. By building on prior advances in deep learning and machine learning, GenAl demonstrates high levels of creativity that allow it to generate unique content such as audio, code, images, text simulations, and videos. This is why GenAl is showing tremendous potential in commercial areas such as content creation, marketing and sales, research, and more.

In a controlled BCG study, GenAl has demonstrated the ability to improve performance on tasks involving ideation and content creation by an average of 40%, and even up to 90%, when compared to performance on similar tasks that were processed without relying on the technology. Such dramatic results demonstrate Al's ability to reimagine processes, enable competitive advantage, and remake industries. Such results are encouraging a wide and fast-growing field or organizations to pursue fully integrating Al into their structures and transforming into future-built companies.

# How does GenAl's rise compare with other viral technologies?

GenAl's potential has led to a surge in media, corporate and consumer interest around the world, especially thanks to OpenAl's ChatGPT platform, which is currently running the fourth version of its GPT language learning model (LLM). Where Spotify took 150 days and Instagram took 75, ChatGPT took just 5 days to record 1 million users. The astounding scale of growth is trumped only by the fact that its growth continued to accelerate, reaching 100 million users in 2 months. ChatGPT has so far recorded the fastest growth rate of any technology in history, and it is fueling further interest in an industry that has already seen $2.7 billion invested between 2021 and 2022.

Anticipating a boon for its own fortunes, Microsoft has invested $10 billion to bring its GenAl potential to its Bing platform, renew its search-engine rivalry with Google, and explore ways to integrate it across its suite of productivity software. Meanwhile, Google has also announced its own GenAl-powered search engine called Bard, Chinese tech giant Baidu has launched a GenAl search bot called ERNIE, and social question and answer website Quora has released its own GenAl service called Sage.

# An Undeniable Tech Revolution

T ech giants competing to maintain their primacy through revamped search engines and chatbots aren't the only arena in which GenAl's potential is surging. It was merely a few months ago that Adobe's Sensei had begun enabling GenAl-powered text-based assistance across its suite of audio, visual and marketing platforms. Platforms such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion had birthed a whole new world of Al-generated art, and companies such as Scenario Al continue to successfully raising funding to perfect Al technology that can generate 3D video game characters and scenes using conversational inputs.

Simultaneously, a flood of low- or no-code Al applications running GenAl are entering the market and promising to transform the entire gamut of business operations for enterprises of all sizes. Rows and Rowy are offering to turn novices into spreadsheet gurus and help businesses become smart by automating the conversion of data into reports. Squarespace wants to leverage GenAl to help smaller businesses build websites faster. Durable is offering small businesses a whole suite of marketing, finance, HR and web services, all powered by the transformative power of GenAl. Additionally, on the back of its first ever conference for developers in November 2023, OpenAl has launched the first-ever app store for an Al platform to complement the far-reaching capabilities of its language learning model. OpenAl will also play a large part in enabling the potential of Microsoft's first change to its keyboards in three decades, the introduction of a dedicated 'Al key' to allow access to Copilot, its new Al tool for Windows 11. Meanwhile, Google has enjoyed success with its ChatGPT competitor Bard and is in the process of integrating it with Gemini, its cutting-edge image generation model which is capable of generating diverse and high-fidelity graphics.

As new GenAl solutions are rolled out weekly, businesses and governments are rushing to take advantage of an undeniable, and unavoidable, tech revolution. The new tech gold rush has led to skyrocketing demand for graphics processing units (GPUs). Previously considered valuable primarily to video gamers, the ability of GPUs to handle multiple complex calculations simultaneously makes them adept at handling complex analytics, research, and Al. It's why Nvidia's stock has risen by 200% in less than eight months to become only the fifth trillion-dollar company by market capitalization in the world.

Governments around the world are now exploring the potential of analytics processing in research and Al and accelerating investments. The US Department of Energy has allocated $1.8 billion to build 2 exascale supercomputers (sourcing GPUs from NVIDIA) for scientific research; the UK Treasury will spend upwards of $1 billion to build its own exascale ‘BritGPT'; both the EU and Japan have also budgeted a combined $1.5 billion to build their own computers roughly a thousand times more powerful than any supercomputer in existence.

## Al's projected economic impact

ChatGPT exponentializing the awareness and use of GenAl technology across diverse domains is evidence of how the rapid evolution of GenAl presents a transformative landscape for nations worldwide. GenAl's advancements offer countries with widespread adoption an incredible opportunity to drive commercial opportunities, stimulate economic activity, and push the boundaries of innovation.

By just 2025, the GenAl global market is estimated to reach up to $100 billion, or 30% of the size of the total Al market. The ability to inject some serious horsepower isn't limited to mere speculations or confined to lab spaces. Industries, ranging from healthcare to entertainment, are already experiencing the transformative impact of GenAl in most systematic or creative tasks, including but not limited to accounting, coding, translation services, and game design.

As more organizations join the movement to explore implementations of GenAl, the expected automation of workplace tasks at an unprecedented scale could lead to significant increases in productivity and GDP. Tech giants, the influential frontrunners in the technological arena, are already taking note of this and rapidly integrating GenAl extensions to automate their myriad services, helping shape a future where customer service queries are managed efficiently by Al, and intricate software glitches are resolved without human intervention.

Findings from MIT and Goldman Sachs suggest GenAl could automate 18% of workplace operations, freeing up more than a third of the time workers take to complete mundane administrative responsibilities and allowing them to devote more brain space to complex problem-solving scenarios. The resulting boost to innovation is projected to increase global GDP by 7% in 10 years and will be felt across all parts of the business sector, from ideation to commercialization.

Novel innovation resulting from GenAl stands to unlock new value for corporations as well as startups, be it in Al-enabled virtual assistants guiding users online, or the intricate algorithms powering autonomous vehicles. Productivity gains will also be felt across every step of the innovation value chain, including discovery, development, and deployment. And as GenAl use grows, its benefits could end up surpassing economic or productivity-related parameters to encompass avenues where creatives harness it to draft episodic screenplays or produce groundbreaking and visually enthralling artwork that captivates audiences.

## Emerging risks

Growth in GenAl usage also presents significant multi-sector risks, especially those related to the ever-expanding remit of national security concerns around the economy, politics, society, military, and cybersecurity.

### MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS

The ability to generate mountains of content on command will inundate information networks, complicating the task of discerning misinformation and disinformation. Sophisticated and convincing fake news, images, and videos proliferating online rapidly have the power to influence public opinion, sow social unrest, and destabilize institutions. Deepfakes, such as the 2018 manipulated video of a US presidential candidate calling on countries to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, can become much more sophisticated and have serious implications for election interference, political tension, and criminal activity. Such content, as well as false narratives, essays, and conspiracy-driven social media bots, can threaten to tarnish countries' reputations, sparking crises and diplomatic conflicts.

### TRUST, BIAS, AND SOCIETY

GenAl is only as good as the data it is trained on. Biased data can perpetuate discriminatory tendencies in areas such as hiring, lending and criminal justice. Additionally, by collecting and analyzing vast personal data, GenAl use raises privacy concerns, as misuse can lead to identity theft, blackmail, invasive advertising, cyberbullying and harassment. Until recently, GenAl systems such as ChatGPT would provide uncited and paraphrased responses, unlike traditional search engines, risking intellectual property and copyright infringement. While GPT-4, Bard and the latest iterations of other LLM's are now capable of providing citations and source-lists, they are still not immune to errors in contextualizing information, or sourcing information accurately.

Furthermore, sophisticated fake reviews and online ratings can erode trust in retail, hospitality, and healthcare organizations. Economically, GenAl-powered automation in industries such as marketing, manufacturing, and healthcare could reshape the job market. The World Economic Forum's estimates suggest 85 million jobs may disappear by 2025, while a former US Treasury Secretary has said that up to a third of men between 25-54 may possibly be out of work by 2050.

## MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY

Global intelligence agencies are increasingly exploring the strategic integration of GenAl technology including in critical intelligence processes. However, the use of GenAl tools in the field is still nascent and needs to be explored more closely. For instance, GenAl tools can sometimes produce 'hallucinations', accidental misinformation, or be erroneously confident in their predictions. Meanwhile, lethal autonomous weapons systems, a growing area of research and investment that don't require human control, use data to predict human behavior, gather intelligence, perform surveillance, and identify potential targets but can make tactical virtual combat decisions that may breach regulations. The latter phenomenon prompted calls at the first UN Security Council meeting on Al in July 2023 to prohibit the use of such weapons technology. Also, unlike nuclear, chemical, or biological agents, Al tools can be moved around the world and leave very little trace, making it harder to take action against malicious actors looking to instigate instability and chaos.

## CYBERSECURITY

The digital economy's growth increases vulnerability to GenAl models trained by cybercriminals and nation- or non-state actors. ChatGPT, for instance, can generate human-like language and produce code in several different programming languages, making it invaluable for potential criminals with little technical knowledge. GenAl can automate sophisticated social engineering lures to increase an attacker's productivity by creating malicious scripts, spreading malware, or using chatbots without accents and language-barriers to conduct phishing attacks. It can also fabricate financial reports, invoices, and other documents to aid fraud and other financial crimes.

## Mitigating risks associated with GenAl

More than 51% of IT professionals predict successful cyberattack incidents enabled by ChatGPT to grow by the end of 2023. But while this might seem alarming, it is important to realize that the vast majority of these can be mitigated. Most of the risks with GenAl use have existed in every nation from well before GenAl use began to surge. A pragmatic and ethical approach that considers regulations to encourage the responsible use of Al, raise citizen's awareness of bias, malicious activity, and 'hallucinations', can go a long way toward alleviating a substantial number of concerns. The possibility of restricting access to adults and leveraging the ability of GenAl systems to empower pre-emptive security measures, such as ethical hacking, is also worthy of consideration.

# The Need for A Holistic Regulatory Framework

I t is becoming increasingly important to advocate for the responsible development, deployment, and use of Al technologies. The benefits of harnessing the potential of GenAl outweigh the risks associated with its use, but the latter must be judiciously managed to further the responsible development, deployment, and use of Al technologies.

Key to any country's development holistic regulatory framework should be rigorous studies assessing GenAl from a broader perspective. These studies should extend beyond being academic and take a multi-faceted stock of the opportunities and use cases of GenAl, threats and mitigation measures, communication strategies, and future directions and recommendations.

Additionally, existing approaches to regulatory frameworks so far have taken the form of one of three focus areas; national security-focused (such as in the US), consumer protection and risk-oriented (as in the EU), and one which utilizes existing regulators to provide guidelines and frameworks on specific use cases (as in the UK and ASEAN countries). Drawing inspiration from a range of responsible Al frameworks, the following principles can serve as a starting point to develop a needed regulatory approach:

*   **Safety, security, and robustness.** With rapidly evolving technologies, such as Al-enabled automation in industrial manufacturing and complex algorithms guiding the development of autonomous vehicle

technology development, frameworks should mandate
stringent testing cycles to ensure public safety. The
AI Risk Management Framework (RIMF) of the US
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is
an example of a mechanism that identifies and classifies
all AI systems based on its purpose and the decision it
makes, allowing the organization itself, as well as those
that it works with, to implement mechanisms such
as technical safeguards, policies and procedures, and
training systems to prevent misuse or harm resulting
from the technology.

*   **Transparency and clarity.** Algorithms should not only
    be understandable, but regulators should have sufficient
    information about AI systems, inputs, and outputs and
    have clarity on how decisions are made. The efforts of
    AI Sweden, the country's national center for applied AI,
    and its collaboration with more than 100 academic
    institutions, as well as public and private sector
    organizations, serve as notable examples of providing a
    clear window into AI-driven decision-making processes.

*   **Fairness.** Regulations should foster equality, human
    rights, data protection, consumer law, and public law.
    The Global Partnership on AI (GPAIF), a joint Canada-France
    initiative, in collaboration with 29 other countries, is a step in
    the right direction towards promoting alignment with
    international conventions on fundamental rights and
    ensuring AI doesn't perpetuate biases, especially in
    critical areas such as immigration and policing.

*   **Contestability.** As mentioned above, GenAI systems
    have been known to err. Should that occur, affected
    parties must be able to make use of regulatory redress
    routes to contest harmful AI outcomes. In the EU, the
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) includes
    provisions that allow individuals to contest decisions
    made solely based on automated processing.

*   **Accountability and governance.** As with any
    regulatory framework, responsibility must be established
    for oversight related to the supply and use of AI systems,
    as well as clear lines of accountability if systems were
    to falter. Singapore's Model AI Governance Framework,
    for instance, lays out comprehensive accountability
    guidelines for AI use and oversight.

*   **Architecture.** Given GenAI's issues with
    misinformation and bias, countries may consider using
    AI software architecture that weeds it out at the source
    by detecting user intent and choosing data sources
    appropriately. Examples of attempts to counter such
    issues include nation-specific GenAI systems, such as
    Falcon 180B, launched by the UAE's Advanced
    Technology and Research Council; as well as the
    UK's Online Safety Bill, soon to become law, which
    proposes to curb misinformation by making social
    media companies responsible for the content they host
    and placing new duties on them to encourage filtering
    inaccurate or harmful material.

# How Countries can Build Resilience
For countries on the cusp of formulating policies
and regulatory frameworks related to the rise of
GenAI in line with the opportunities and risks
outlined above, examining the approaches of countries
further along in their journeys can provide valuable
insights toward regulating the AI space. These strategies
work to strike a balance: creating fertile ground for the
space's further growth, while also mitigating areas in
which the negative impact of the technology can be felt,
in order to strive for global leadership in promoting the
development and adoption of AI.

Several national approaches stress the importance
of ethics and the overarching burden of responsibility
associated with the use of AI technologies. For instance,
France, through its Plan AI, and the UK, through its AI
Sector Deal, are funding research into AI safety and the
development of techniques to detect and prevent its
malicious use, as well as enacting public education
initiatives on the potential risks involved in the use
of the technology. These countries aren't just passively
cautioning against the pitfalls of AI; they're proactively
investing in AI safety research. By sponsoring the
development of methods to detect and counteract harmful
AI applications, they are establishing a framework that
promotes safe innovation. Furthermore, recognizing
the importance of an informed public, these nations
are launching educational campaigns to raise awareness
about the potential risks and rewards of AI.

On the other hand, the US National Security Commission
on Artificial Intelligence has taken a proactive national
security-facing stance on GenAI, acknowledging its role as
a tool for advancement and as one to bring more
robustness to its overall national defense. The mandate
here is two-fold: implement defensive initiatives to mitigate
national security risks and allow the country to lead the
field in terms of AI-response based national security
technology.

STEERING THE GENAI SHIP: POLICY CONSIDERATIONS FOR A SMART AND RESILIENT FUTURE

## UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (USA)
While the US Government's Blueprint for an AI Bill
of Rights provides guidance to businesses on the ethical
use of AI tools, regulators in the country are calling
for increased laws and provisions to ensure consumer,
economic, and international safety. Additionally, the
US Chamber of Commerce, based on its AI Commission
report, is pushing for a risk-based AI regulatory framework,
similar to frameworks proposed in the EU.

The US State Department has also released the Political
Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial
Intelligence and Autonomy, outlining best practices for
the ethical and accountable development, deployment,
and use of military AI capabilities, including autonomous
systems. The document emphasizes adherence to
international law and maintaining human control.

In terms of industry, tech leaders are proactively
collaborating to develop best practices for the responsible
use of AI. The Partnership on AI includes companies such
as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, and has been
established to ensure that AI is used for the benefit of
society. Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic, have
also established the Frontier Model Forum to draw on their
combined technical and operational expertise to develop
technical benchmarks and a public library of solutions that
can support industry best practices in AI.

## UNITED KINGDOM (UK)
The UK Government's AI Code lays down guidelines
for the safe, trustworthy, and ethical development and
deployment of AI systems while striking a balance between
copyright holders and generative AI firms to benefit both
parties from the use of copyrighted material in training
data. However, despite the guidelines efforts, the UK
Government's 2022 Policy Paper on AI Regulation made
no specific reference to GenAI models such as ChatGPT.

In March 2023, the UK issued the Pro-innovation
Regulation of Technologies Review Digital Technologies
report calling for regulatory sandboxes for AI and issuing
a clear position on the relationship between AI and
intellectual property rights.

## EUROPEAN UNION (EU)
Since April 2021, the EU has been at the forefront of
developing a comprehensive legal framework with its
proposed AI Act. The regulation is less restrictive and
intends to address several concerns related to the use
of AI, including privacy, transparency, accountability, and
safety. The AI Act is now nearing its final stages before
ratification; however, it has faced intense lobbying against
it from US tech companies. The main provisions of the AI
Act include:

*   **Risk-based approach:** The regulation defines high-risk
    AI systems as those that pose significant risks to the
    health, safety, or fundamental rights of individuals,
    such as AI systems used in healthcare, transportation,
    or public services. Higher-risk AI systems are subject
    to more stringent requirements.

*   **Prohibition of certain AI applications:** The regulation
    prohibits certain AI applications that are considered
    to pose an unacceptable risk to the safety, health,
    or fundamental rights of individuals, such as AI
    systems used for social scoring or exploitation of
    vulnerable groups.

*   **Transparency and accountability:** Systems must be
    transparent and explainable, with clear documentation
    and traceability. Developers and deployers of AI systems
    are also required to maintain appropriate records and
    conduct risk assessments.

*   **Certification:** Proposes the creation of a voluntary
    EU-level certification scheme for AI systems to provide
    assurance to users and to facilitate cross-border
    deployment of AI systems.

*   **Enforcement and supervision:** Proposes the establishment
    of a European Artificial Intelligence Board (EAIB), which
    will oversee the implementation of regulations and
    ensure consistent enforcement across the EU.

Additionally, to help the European law enforcement
community, The Europol Innovation Lab organized several
workshops with subject matter experts from across its
domain to explore how criminals can abuse GenAI systems
such as ChatGPT, as well as how the technology can assist
investigators in their daily work.

## CHINA
The Cyberspace Administration of China has recently
implemented regulations to establish boundaries and
restrictions on the misuse of deep synthesis technology,
including GenAI algorithms that utilize deep learning to
generate content. These restrictions align with existing
regulations governing various consumer internet services
in China, such as social media, games, and short videos.
As an example, the use of generative AI is prohibited for
activities that pose a threat to national security, undermine
public interest, or are deemed illegal.

## SINGAPORE
The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)
and the Personal Data Protection Commission have
jointly created AI Verify, an AI governance testing
framework and toolkit aimed at enabling industries
to demonstrate responsible AI deployment. Currently
available as a minimum viable product (MVP), this
framework allows system developers and owners to
enhance transparency regarding the performance of
their AI systems. It achieves this through a combination
of technical tests and process checks. Additionally,
the Personal Data Protection Commission has developed
the AI Model Framework, providing comprehensive and
actionable guidance to private sector organizations on
addressing ethical and governance considerations when
implementing AI solutions.

In the financial sector, the Monetary Authority of
Singapore has introduced the Principles to Promote
Fairness, Ethics, Accountability, and Transparency (FEAT)
in the Use of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics.
This framework of principles serves as a guide for
decision-making involving artificial intelligence and
data analytics (AIDA) in the provision of financial products
and services, promoting fairness and responsible use of
these technologies.

# Policy prescriptions for nations deliberating an Al framework
GenAI is a vastly powerful technology with
ramifications across a country's general economy,
politics, society as well as national security. While
it is encouraging to see several countries progressing in
the development of comprehensive frameworks related to
the use and proliferation and risks of AI, others are still at
early stages in their journey with a limited set of measures
pertaining to AI ethics and personal data protection, sandbox
environments to test localized solutions for product and
services advancement, and not enough attention given to
national security and cybersecurity concerns.

The rise of AI presents a frontier with which economies can
rapidly position itself themselves as leaders, and by
formulating comprehensive and empowering holistic AI
strategies, help protect their national security interests. To
kickstart agendas related to these goals, a national effort
which engages relevant stakeholders across cybersecurity,
AI and the broader technology industry, as well as institutions
tasked with creating policies, can ensure end-to-end
deployment of measures. This effort is to focus on joint
initiatives such as:

## Promoting Ethical and Responsible GenAl Development
*   **Prioritizing Ethical Considerations.** Ethical
    considerations must be at the forefront of GenAI
    development policies. To achieve this, it is recommended
    that policies explicitly state the prioritization of ethical
    principles in the creation and deployment of GenAI
    systems. For instance, ensuring that GenAI systems
    used in healthcare prioritize patient privacy and safety,

BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP + DUBAI FUTURE FOUNDATION

aligning with ethical medical standards. Additionally,
establishing stronger governance for GenAl by classifying
Al applications and enforcing detailed certifications
for high-risk Al systems will help ensure ethical
development, similar to prohibitions on unacceptable
applications like social scoring.

*   **Fostering International Collaboration.** Collaboration
    on an international scale is crucial in shaping robust
    GenAl ethical standards. Therefore, it is recommended
    that nations collaborate actively to harmonize and
    adopt international ethical GenAl standards.
    For example, countries can work together to develop
    a shared framework for addressing ethical concerns
    in autonomous vehicles, ensuring consistency and
    safety worldwide. Collaborative alliances can also
    help in addressing GenAl cybersecurity risks,
    activating research and development capabilities,
    and establishing guidelines and standards for the
    responsible use of generative Al technology.
*   **Balancing Innovation and Safeguards.** Striking a
    balance between encouraging GenAl innovation and
    safeguarding against misuse is paramount. It
    is recommended that GenAl policies incorporate
    mechanisms that adapt to evolving ethical challenges
    while supporting innovation. For instance, as Al-
    driven content generation becomes more prevalent in
    journalism, policies should adapt to ensure accurate
    and unbiased reporting while promoting innovative
    storytelling techniques. These policies can cover
    safeguards that ensure facts are independently verified
    as well as standards that ensure disclosure and labelling
    for human vs Al-generated content. An approach
    worthy of consideration is approving language learning
    models (LLMs) similar to how the US Food and Drug
    Administration certifies whether food and medicinal
    products are fit for consumption. Through regular
    monitoring, auditing, and the establishment of standards
    and rules for GenAl use, as well as the development of a
    dedicated GenAl Toolkit, industry and organizations can
    be supported in developing and deploying responsible
    and secure Al.

# Ensuring Data Privacy and Security

*   **Robust Data Protection Measures.** To protect
    user data effectively, it is recommended that GenAl
    policies mandate stringent data protection measures.
    These measures should encompass data security
    protocols, encryption standards, and data access
    controls to ensure the highest level of privacy protection
    when deploying GenAl systems. An example includes
    stringent encryption standards for GenAl-powered
    financial transactions to safeguard sensitive information.
    Establishing governing rules for each category of
    GenAl applications can further strengthen data
    security and privacy.
*   **Privacy-Respecting Practices.** GenAl regulations
    should encourage the adoption of privacy-respecting
    practices and technologies. By doing so, GenAl developers
    can create systems that respect individuals' privacy
    rights while utilizing Al-generated content. These
    practices should be embedded in the development
    process to ensure privacy is upheld at every stage. As
    an example, social media platforms can use GenAl to
    personalize content while respecting users' privacy and
    data. Building GenAl awareness through privacy and
    digital awareness campaigns is crucial to prevent misuse
    and enhance data protection.

# Addressing Intellectual Property and Copyright

*   **Clarifying Intellectual Property Implications.**
    It is essential to address the policy implications of
    GenAl on intellectual property rights. Therefore, it is
    recommended that policies include a clear assessment
    of these implications. This will provide guidance
    on ownership, attribution, and the protection of Al-
    generated content, ensuring a fair and balanced
    approach to intellectual property. For instance, policies
    can clarify that Al-generated art can be protected by
    copyright when created under certain conditions, similar
    to human-created art. Monitoring and auditing regularly
    to detect intellectual property violations is also essential.
*   **Standards for Copyright Protection.** To maintain
    clarity and fairness, it is recommended that GenAl
    policies set clear standards for copyright protection
    of Al-generated content. By doing so, we provide
    content creators, Al developers, and the public with
    a clear framework for understanding their rights and
    responsibilities. An example might involve setting
    standards for attributing Al-generated content in
    digital marketing materials to ensure transparency
    and proper credit. Establishing an independent GenAl
    governance board can oversee the implementation of
    GenAl regulations, ensuring consistent enforcement and
    protection of intellectual property rights.

# Ensuring Accountability and Liability

*   **Defining Responsibility Clearly.** To address
    accountability, it is recommended that policies clearly
    define and allocate responsibilities for GenAl-related
    harm. This includes specifying the roles and obligations
    of Al developers, users, and other stakeholders in cases
    of harm or misuse. Clarity in responsibility ensures
    fairness and accountability in the GenAl ecosystem.
    For example, if an autonomous vehicle is involved in an
    accident, policies can define whether the responsibility
    lies with the vehicle's manufacturer, the software developer,
    or the user. Conducting assessments to identify potential
    high-risk uses-cases for GenAl and evaluating strategies
    to limit exposure to national security threats or cyber-
    risks can enhance accountability further.

*   **Mandatory Insurance and Certification.** To enhance
    accountability, it is recommended that policies consider
    the implementation of mandatory insurance or liability
    coverage for GenAl developers, structured in a way that
    aligns with the potential risks. Furthermore, encouraging Al
    developers and users to undergo certification or training
    can minimize risks and promote responsible use of GenAl
    systems. For instance, Al-powered medical diagnostics
    should require certification for practitioners to ensure
    accurate and safe healthcare outcomes.

# Fostering International Cooperation and Standards

*   **Developing Global Norms and Standards.** To
    create a cohesive framework for GenAl governance,
    it is recommended that nations actively collaborate
    to develop and adopt global norms and standards for
    GenAl. These international guidelines will provide a
    common foundation for ethical, legal, and technical
    aspects of GenAl development, fostering consistency
    and cooperation. An example includes developing
    global standards for data sharing in climate modeling
    to address global environmental challenges collectively.
    De-risking GenAl by conducting assessments and
    identifying potential high-risk use cases can enhance
    international cooperation in addressing cybersecurity
    risks associated with GenAl.
*   **Efficient Cross-Border Data Flow Management:
    Managing cross-border data flows is vital in a
    global GenAl ecosystem.** Policies should focus on the
    development of mechanisms that ensure efficient data
    flow management while respecting diverse regulatory
    frameworks. This approach will facilitate the exchange
    of data and knowledge across borders while maintain-
    ing compliance with regional regulations. An example
    might involve cross-border medical data sharing for
    research and treatment, where data privacy and security
    standards are upheld across jurisdictions. Collaboration
    opportunities with other national regulatory entities can
    help address GenAl security challenges, including data
    ownership and cybersecurity risks.

# The need of the hour

Al's rapid emergence belies years of innovation and
development at the heart of its emergence as technology's
latest revolution. With billions around the world grappling
with its tremendous potential, the fact is becoming clearer
than ever that the age of Al has indeed arrived. But as the
last few moments in technology, from the internet to social
media, have shown, the promise of potential also brings
with it an increased possibility of upheaval.

Fortunately, for policymakers, most of the risks associated
with GenAl's use are addressable with proactive and
comprehensive governance. In fact, Al-related governance
frameworks could help more adequately address the
shortfalls in policymaking that slipped through the cracks
during social media's emergence as a phenomenon. What
nations need is to take a holistic view of GenAl's potential,
raise awareness of its opportunities and implications, and
work in a whole-of-government collaboratively to develop
tools, guidelines, and governance mechanisms that can
regulate its use. Through robust frameworks that promote
safe development and use, policymakers can help accelerate
economic agendas, bolster internal resilience, strengthen
national preparedness, and allow Al to be recognized as a
positive force.
