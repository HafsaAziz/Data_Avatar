In many domains, artificial intelligence (AI) is moving from experimentation to practical application, reshaping the nature of work and enterprise collaboration. Strategic foresight is no exception. Al is beginning to transform how organizations detect, interpret and act on signals of change, offering new capabilities for scanning, analysis and scenario development.

This white paper, developed jointly by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Economic Forum, presents new evidence from a global survey of foresight practitioners across government, business, academia and civil society. The results show a field in transition: most practitioners are using Al to support research, automate analysis and expand access to data, while a smaller group is experimenting with Al as a creative or analytical partner in scenario design and systems mapping.

The report also highlights key barriers to progress: gaps in technical capacity, concerns about reliability and transparency, and the need for governance frameworks that align Al use with public value and ethical principles. Addressing these challenges will determine whether Al strengthens or distorts foresight practice.

This publication aims to inform and inspire foresight practitioners and policy-makers as they navigate this evolving landscape. By investing in Al literacy in foresight teams, creating safe spaces for experimentation and building shared standards for responsible use, we can ensure Al contributes to more anticipatory, adaptive and informed policy-making.

# Executive summary

## Al's intersection with strategic foresight offers both opportunities and challenges.

Innovations in Al have opened the door to possible future scenarios that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. The technology affects decision-makers around the world, and perhaps none more than practitioners of strategic foresight – the field where experts explore multiple plausible futures and develop strategies to help organizations, governments and others prepare for events to come. To evaluate Al's impact on strategic foresight, this white paper presents the results of a survey of 167 foresight experts from 55 countries, drawn from the World Economic Forum's Global Foresight Network, the OECD Government Foresight Community and the Dubai Future Foundation.

The results show that a majority of foresight practitioners now use Al in their work. Practitioners report that the technology is useful for essential elements of foresight such as trend analysis, future scenario development and identification of emerging themes and issues. Experts primarily value Al for saving time, saying it streamlines their work by handling repetitive and labour-intensive tasks. Respondents also appreciate Al's ability to process and analyse large datasets, uncovering trends and insights that would be difficult or time-consuming to identify manually.

However, the survey reveals diverging opinions in the field about the technology's usefulness, accessibility and reliability. Many respondents express concerns about the quality and trustworthiness of Al-generated content, noting that it is prone to hallucinations, operates without transparency and can produce biased results. Al is also reported to have limited capacity for inductive reasoning, as the technology draws from existing knowledge and struggles to embrace the forward-looking perspectives needed for strategic foresight.

The survey also highlights gaps in how Al technologies are seen by practitioners in the public and private sectors, academia and civil society, with those in the private sector feeling most confident in their abilities to use Al in their strategic foresight work. Furthermore, respondents say that in some cases - for example with public sector workers operating under data security and confidentiality restrictions - a lack of established Al usage guidelines can hamper foresight practitioners' ability to fully realize the opportunities Al can offer.

This white paper includes recommendations to take advantage of areas where Al can augment foresight, and to limit its potential pitfalls. These include increasing Al literacy among the global foresight community and encouraging experimentation to move beyond simple use cases of the technology. Al tools can help supplement - but not replace - human efforts in the field of strategic foresight, with Al handling tasks such as data processing and initial drafts, thereby freeing up time for experts' higher-level analysis, interpretation and critical thinking.

# Introduction

## Al is reshaping the world of anticipatory governance.

Strategic foresight – the disciplined exploration of possible futures to inform present-day decision-making – has long served as a cornerstone for resilience and long-term governance. Effective foresight requires challenging existing mental frames and cognitive biases, and cultivating openness, imagination and creativity to see beyond the immediate and the familiar. It is grounded in the present, yet anchored in an understanding of the past, connecting historical insight to forward-looking analysis. Foresight enables governments, businesses and societies to identify emerging opportunities and risks, and to make more adaptive choices that boost resilience in an increasingly complex and uncertain world.

At the World Economic Forum, the Strategic Foresight team convenes the Global Foresight Network,¹ a community of practice across public and private sectors that serves as an incubator to accelerate and advance the practice of foresight and future-preparedness. At the OECD, the Strategic Foresight Unit champions the OECD Government Foresight Community (GFC),² which brings together public sector strategic foresight practitioners and exchanges information on the latest foresight developments in government for better policy-making.³ Together the Forum and OECD have been assessing the impact Al will have on the practice of foresight, recognizing that, as Al becomes one of the most transformative forces of the 21st century, it has the potential to fundamentally reshape foresight adoption and methodology.

The intersection of Al and foresight offers both opportunity and challenge – the potential to democratize access to anticipatory tools that were once resource-intensive and institutionally bound, and the risk of distorting or over-automating the very processes it enhances. Al can broaden participation by augmenting analytical capacity, pattern recognition and scenario generation, empowering more actors to explore and prepare for alternative futures. Yet, these same tools can also introduce new dependencies, amplify biases and accelerate short-term decision-making at the expense of deep reflection.

Al is transforming economies, governments and societies with unprecedented speed.⁴ It is reshaping how value is created, policies are designed and services are delivered. From the OECD’s perspective, the public sector has a unique opportunity to embed Al within the policy cycle, using real-time data and feedback to strengthen foresight, accountability and evidence-based decision-making. The OECD’s 2025 Governing with Al report and its Framework for Trustworthy Al in Government underscore that trustworthy deployment relies on three pillars – enablers, guardrails and engagement – aligning with OECD AI Principles⁵ on human-centred, inclusive growth.

## Objective

The same dynamism that fuels Al’s promise makes foresight indispensable to its governance. Both the OECD and the Forum recognize that responsible Al requires anticipatory capacity – strategic foresight helps address the Collingridge dilemma by encouraging public bodies and firms alike to experiment, prototype and scenario-plan for shifting technological, social and geopolitical contexts. Public institutions need to build anticipatory capacity to prepare for how Al will reshape their functions and the nature of policy itself.⁶ In parallel, businesses must embed strategic foresight, accountability and transparency into every layer of their Al strategy and operations. This means aligning responsible Al with core business goals, establishing empowered governance and risk frameworks, and ensuring trustworthy data, ethical design and workforce literacy. In doing so, companies can innovate confidently while safeguarding trust, resilience and long-term value creation.

As such, the purpose of this paper is to conduct a first assessment of how the foresight field itself is being transformed by Al. To understand this evolution, the OECD and the World Economic Forum have explored how Al is being integrated into foresight practices across public, private, academic and civil society domains. In mid-2025, a global survey of 167 foresight experts from 55 countries – drawn from the OECD Government Foresight Community, the Forum’s Global Foresight Network, and the Dubai Future Foundation network – revealed that two-thirds of practitioners already use Al in their work. The findings that follow provide an early empirical view of how Al is reshaping foresight methodologies, accessibility and the broader ecosystem of anticipatory governance.

# ① Al skills and capacity
A sizeable gap exists in Al skills across sectors.

The perception of relevant Al skills for strategic foresight (Figure 1) varies across sectors. Public sector employees in general tend to be more modest in their assessment of their own abilities compared to strategic foresight experts from other sectors, particularly those from the private sector. Some 53% of public sector respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that they had relevant skills to use Al in their strategic foresight work, and similar numbers were reported by respondents from civil society (57%) and academia (59%). However, 93% of private sector respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement.

Those who did not have experience with Al reported limited ideas about the possibilities that Al may provide. This may point to a need for a more coordinated and systematic increase of Al literacy in the public sector through training and active experimentation.

Currently, the bulk of strategic foresight experts use off-the-shelf Al tools (51% of respondents), while 12% use customized solutions and 32% use hybrid solutions. The most common platforms used by the respondents are CoPilot (22%), ChatGPT/OpenAl (16%), Claude (12%), Gemini (12%), Perplexity (11%) and Deepseek (7%).

Most strategic foresight experts use two or more tools simultaneously, with some using up to 50 different tools. Some 27% of the respondents reported that their organization was collaborating with other organizations to develop Al-enabled foresight, and another 34% said their organization was planning to do so.

Customized tools tend to integrate Al into existing foresight methodologies (e.g. the Radical Technology Inquirer), develop new tools or use the APIs (application programming interfaces) of different large language models (LLMs) for internal analysis purposes. These tools are used to collect documents automatically, detect signals or analyse documents in support of foresight activities (see some examples in Box 1).

## BOX 1 Examples of tools used by strategic foresight experts

The survey respondents mentioned some specific use cases of Al for strategic foresight:

- Custom Al-based platform designed to generate predictive evaluations of emerging technologies.
- Al-powered platforms designed to provide predictive insights through the simulation of user-guided alternative future scenarios.
- Al-enhanced cloud system that collects and processes multi-source news information using event-based modelling and ontologies.
- Al-enhanced custom oriented platform for the persistent, autonomous reconnaissance of global supply chains.
- Closed-access organizational tools developed by and used within a large international organization.

Source: OECD

In sum, strategic foresight experts are using Al predominantly for trend analysis or clustering (69%), scenario development (63%) and horizon scanning (60%) (see figure 2). There are no large differences in use between sectors, albeit those working in academia use Al tools more for horizon scanning, trend analysis and clustering than other sectors, while scenario development is most common in the private sector and civil society.

Many also use Al for data and scenario visualizations. Civil society also tends to do more predictive modelling or forecasting (33% of respondents using Al in the sector), which could possibly be linked to many digital government initiatives in the sector.

In addition to the outlined functionalities, strategic foresight experts also reported using Al for designing persona profiles, extrapolating wild cards and extreme scenarios, looking for bias or blind spots in thinking (especially expanding human-generated analysis) and as a reference library for strategic foresight methodologies.

When it comes to the integration of Al into strategic foresight processes in general, practice varies.

## 1 Level one: Al for analysis augmentation

Those who have not experimented with a variety of tools or do not have customized solutions tend to use Al for simpler tasks in the research phase (synthesis of data, initial scanning, sensemaking, etc.). This is true for the majority of strategic foresight experts surveyed. Here, Al tools are particularly useful for gathering, organizing and synthesizing large amounts of information on a case-by-case basis, providing a base layer of insights that can later be deepened and contextualized by human experts. Al tools are seen as complementary but stand-alone solutions, which mainly contribute to human-centred workflows.

Al tools are purely supplemental; they help speed the workflow by about 10-15%, but they require careful analysis and existing expertise.

## 2 Level two: Al as creative sparring partner

The next reported level of maturity tends to be using Al as a sparring partner and idea generator, wind-tunnelling ideas and stress-testing human-generated content. At this point, Al tools help to systematize and summarize signals, offer ideas for the structure of the study, suggest scenarios based on the uploaded data, help to compare the collected signals with other factual data and help to speed up the search for relevant information. Here, survey respondents reported direct efficiency and productivity increases, such as increased throughput of scenarios developed, wider wind-tunnelling activities and increased scalability of outputs.

Al tools are a useful support to scan horizons and work on environmental scanning, engage in megatrend analysis and simulation, speculate futures and prepare visualizations for leadership with short notice. While Al helps to increase speed and provides (in many cases) analytical depth, it has to be considered as a complement to human expertise and experience, not as a substitute.

## 3 Level three: Al integrated and customized into workflow

The third level is currently very rare and denotes the integration of Al into the entire strategic foresight process, with various fit-for-purpose tools developed for horizon scanning, options and combinations of methods, scoping the research question, testing it and communicating it externally. For these cases, more tailored tools are utilized that allow for complexity mapping, pattern detection, etc. Here, strategic foresight experts are actively experimenting with Al applications (including Al agents) on a continuous basis, including actively automating different parts of the strategic foresight process such as signal detection, trends analysis, scenario development, simulations and stress testing, visualization of alternative futures and other outputs.

Al is integrated as a significant component of the foresight process. Experts are actively experimenting with Al applications that enable capabilities previously infeasible, including automated document collection, automated signal collection and automatic analysis of documents as inputs for scenario development and other foresight outputs.

# 3) Benefits and challenges
Al's advantages come with potential hazards.

The perception of Al's usefulness for strategic foresight (Figure 3) varies across sectors, with a generally positive perception, except in the public sector. This perception is certainly influenced by "experience of use" - those who have used Al for strategic foresight in practice have a much higher perception of its usefulness. As such, 43% of those who had experience with using Al reported that the technology was either essential or highly useful to their work, another 47% of this group found it moderately useful; the corresponding numbers for those who had not used Al for strategic foresight were 16% (essential or high relevance) and 33% (moderately useful).

As such, there is a strong consensus among those strategic foresight experts who currently use Al that the technology is most valuable for its ability to accelerate and streamline processes, particularly in the early stages of foresight work. This efficiency gain allows practitioners to focus on more complex, high-level tasks that require human judgement and creativity. The benefits of using Al in strategic foresight reported by those using it can be grouped into six key themes:

1.  Time efficiency and acceleration (39%): Al is primarily valued for saving time and accelerating workflows. It streamlines research, analysis and production by handling repetitive and labour-intensive tasks, allowing faster completion of outputs.
2.  Data processing and analysis (17%): Respondents appreciate Al's ability to process and analyse large datasets efficiently, uncovering trends and insights that would be difficult or time-consuming to identify manually.
3.  Idea generation and creativity (12%): Al supports creativity by generating new ideas, first drafts and alternative perspectives, helping users overcome creative blocks and explore novel directions.
4.  Scenario development (10%): Al enhances scenario-building by rapidly generating, refining and testing multiple future scenarios, improving both speed and completeness in strategic foresight.
5.  Improved quality and scope (7%): Al helps improve the overall quality, structure and breadth of work, enabling more comprehensive research and better-designed outputs.
6.  Support for non-experts and beginners (4%): Al makes foresight methods more accessible by reducing expertise and resource barriers, helping newcomers participate more effectively in analytical or strategic processes.

In conclusion, the survey results clearly show that Al is perceived as a powerful tool for enhancing the efficiency, speed and scope of strategic foresight. While it is not yet seen as a replacement for human expertise – with several respondents noting the need for “checking legitimacy” and expert analysis – it is widely viewed as a valuable partner that handles the heavy-lifting of data processing and initial drafts, freeing up human practitioners for higher-level analysis, interpretation and critical thinking.

# 3.1 Reported challenges

The biggest challenges in integrating Al into strategic foresight are related to ethical or governance concerns, lack of technical expertise and difficulty in aligning Al with human-centred foresight (Figure 4). Technical expertise is, unsurprisingly, less of a barrier for those who have already used Al for strategic foresight (Figure 5), but keeping up with the best tools available was reported as a challenge across the board. Resistance from leadership or stakeholders was reportedly faced mostly by public sector, civil society and academia members; this is reportedly not an issue for the private sector respondents who participated in the survey.

Additional challenges reported by strategic foresight experts (both who use and do not use Al already) were related to the unreliability of Al outputs: their quality and tendencies towards hallucinations, lack of transparency, language and other biases, and noise. Moreover, in many cases Al was reported to have limited capacity for inductive reasoning. Because Al systems are built upon only existing knowledge, they struggle to identify forward-looking perspectives, unknown/low probability signals and potential disruptions, all of which are necessary for strategic foresight.

Furthermore, especially in the public sector context, data security concerns and government silos were listed as barriers. To improve the quality of outputs, more intentionality and tailoring in both use and tools was seen as necessary. However, strategic foresight experts also reported a lack of resources and time for necessary experimentation.

Given these concerns, despite efficiencies, users have significant reservations about Al's trustworthiness and ability to deliver truly novel or nuanced insights without extensive human oversight. These can be summarized by frequency of mentions as follows:

1.  Output quality and trustworthiness (30%): The main concern is that Al often produces unreliable, shallow or unoriginal outputs. Respondents doubt its ability to deliver deep analysis, novel insights or credible foresight without human oversight.
2.  Transparency and verification (12%): Practitioners struggle with Al's lack of transparency and unclear reasoning. Because the sources and logic behind its outputs are hidden, significant human effort is required for validation and fact-checking, turning the process into an audit rather than an exercise.
3.  Bias and data limitations (10%): Respondents worry about biased and narrow outputs due to Al's dependence on English-language, Western and historical data. Its limited access to private or emerging information restricts global and forward-looking analysis.
4.  Organizational and ethical issues (10%): Concerns extend to data security, unclear rules on ownership and citation, and the risk of over-reliance on Al. Many organizations lack formal ethical frameworks to guide responsible use. This is problematic – only 27% of experts using Al already said their organizations had formal ethical guidelines in place (Figure 6).
5.  Methodological and usage challenges (10%): Using Al effectively is seen as difficult. Crafting strong prompts and maintaining quality requires expertise, with Al often reverting to simple or inconsistent outputs.

The challenges outlined above indicate that Al is currently viewed as a tool that augments, rather than replaces, human expertise, requiring careful and continuous oversight to ensure the quality and ethical soundness of foresight work.

# ④ Perspectives on the future

## Foresight practitioners must ensure that Al does not undermine the field.

As Al is developing rapidly and its impacts are difficult to assess holistically, a majority of strategic foresight experts surveyed said the risks connected with the technology were contextual and dependent on how Al is designed, governed and applied (Figure 7).

Nevertheless, 19% of the respondents predicted moderate risks to the profession and 6% of respondents judged there to be a very high risk that Al will significantly undermine effective foresight practices. The proportions of these responses were largely the same for both those already using Al in their strategic foresight practice and those who were not doing so yet.

As strategic foresight practitioners are also facing the Collingridge dilemma (not all risks associated with Al will be foreseeable before adoption at scale and the establishment of path dependencies that are hard to break), these risks should be taken seriously.

With this in mind, anticipatory capacity is needed in the public sector in general, but also in the strategic foresight practice itself to tackle these risks as early as possible through experimentation and by following risk management practices.⁷

    *   **Depends on context - Risks will vary based on how Al is designed, governed, and applied:** 65%
    *   **Very low risk - Al will pose minimal or no threat to foresight:** 5%
    *   **Not sure:** 5%

Source: OECD

The views of experts on the more specific impacts of Al on strategic foresight practitioners themselves and the technology's influence on decision-making varied based on their prior experience with Al (see Figures 8 and 9). For example, 18% of respondents who had experience with Al in strategic foresight predicted that Al will significantly or somewhat reduce their role, while 32% of the same group said Al will significantly support or enhance their role (Figure 8).

Similarly, on the positive side, 22% of those having experience with Al said they expected the technology to have strongly positive impact on strategic foresight being integrated into decision-making, compared to only 11% from the group who were not using Al in their strategic foresight work (Figure 9). On the whole, on both accounts, the majority across both groups tended to evaluate the impact of Al on the profession positively rather than negatively.

A contradictory risk that arises is: the use of Al may make foresight more accessible to people and therefore more widely used but, if the foresight outputs are of poor quality due to the issues previously identified, trust in the process may be lost, thus undoing progress made in embedding foresight into decision-making.

# Conclusion

The insights from the OECD-World Economic Forum survey highlight a pivotal moment for the foresight profession. While the findings confirm Al's potential to enhance efficiency, they also reveal a range of challenges and uncertainties.

## Opportunities

**Increasing Al literacy:** A notable finding is the disparity in perceived Al skills across sectors, with public sector respondents reporting a more modest assessment of their capabilities compared to the private sector. This may necessitate a coordinated and systematic increase of Al literacy in the public sector through training and active experimentation.

Practitioners, particularly those without prior experience, often have limited ideas about Al's potential, and can therefore be less well positioned to identify, and avoid, its pitfalls. An active, experimental approach is crucial, as the survey found that experience with Al significantly increases the perception of its usefulness. This is not simply about adopting off-the-shelf tools but also about automating different parts of the strategic foresight process, augmenting human creativity and developing tailored solutions.

**Moving beyond simple use cases:** The survey indicates that most strategic foresight practitioners currently use Al for simpler tasks, such as synthesizing data, initial scanning and sense-making. While this is a valuable starting point, the future lies in more advanced applications. Practitioners should invest time in using Al as a sparring partner and idea generator, and to systematize and summarize signals, suggest scenarios and compare collected data. The aim is for a level of maturity where Al is integrated into the entire strategic foresight process, with tailored tools developed for complexity mapping, pattern detection and communication of findings.

**Developing human-centred workflows:** The survey reinforces the notion that Al tools are purely supplemental and require careful analysis and existing human expertise. Strategic foresight practitioners should invest in developing workflows that leverage Al to handle the "heavy lifting" of data processing and initial drafts, thereby freeing up time for higher-level analysis, interpretation and critical thinking. The objective is to use Al to enable capabilities previously infeasible, such as automated signal detection and large-scale document analysis, while maintaining human oversight for nuance and originality in addition to verification of outputs.

## Challenges

The survey highlights that while most practitioners are optimistic about Al's potential, they also recognize significant risks.

**Guarding against unreliable and biased outputs:** The most frequently cited challenge is the quality and trustworthiness of Al-generated outputs. This includes the concern of hallucinations, weak and shallow content, and a general lack of originality or imagination. Practitioners must maintain a critical mindset and implement robust verification protocols to fact-check Al outputs, especially since a lack of transparency regarding sources and logic is a major concern. Different Al tools could be used in parallel to validate and check results.

**Addressing ethical and governance gaps:** The survey found that a significant challenge is a lack of clear ethical guidelines and governance. This is compounded by data security and confidentiality restrictions, which prevent the feeding of sensitive internal documents into Al engines. Strategic foresight practitioners may need to advocate for and help develop ethical frameworks that address issues of data ownership, accountability and responsible use of Al.⁸ Across countries, there is a lack of guidance and resources to experiment with Al in government in a responsible way.⁹

**Tackling skill gaps:** The survey highlighted a differing Al literacy rate among strategic foresight experts. Successfully experimenting with and integrating Al into strategic foresight processes also requires a certain level of skills in both Al and data management. Targeted hiring and internal upskilling and training programmes for strategic foresight teams can help increase the internal capacity needed to ensure a more systemic uptake of Al.

**Overcoming organizational inertia:** The survey showed that respondents in the public sector, civil society and academia face resistance from leadership or other stakeholders when integrating Al. This is linked to a general climate of risk aversion and a lack of resources and time for the necessary experimentation. Practitioners need to build a compelling case for the value of Al, demonstrating its benefits through small-scale experiments and pilots. Successfully integrating Al into foresight may be one of the best ways to demonstrate the systemically connected issues affecting any organization and, as such, this integration could help governments overcome exactly those silos.

**Maintaining and enhancing human expertise:** The findings present a key dilemma for the profession: while Al can enhance productivity, there is a risk of "deskilling" or over-reliance on the tools with significant limitations. Al's ability to provide existing knowledge rather than forward-looking perspectives means that human foresight expertise may be more critical than ever to identify unknown, low-probability signals and potential disruptions.

Taken together, these findings suggest that Al is becoming both a catalyst and a capability test for strategic foresight itself. As governments and businesses depend on foresight to navigate uncertainty, the uneven distribution of Al skills – particularly the public sector’s relative lack of confidence compared to industry – signals a widening gap in anticipatory capacity.

The integration of Al into strategic foresight is not a technical problem to be solved but a strategic transformation to be managed. The path forward requires deliberate investment in human and technological capabilities, robust governance to ensure trustworthiness, and a culture of continuous experimentation. By taking these steps, governments and businesses can ensure that Al becomes a powerful enabler of more resilient, creative and insightful decision-making – strengthening their ability to navigate uncertainty and shape the future with confidence.
