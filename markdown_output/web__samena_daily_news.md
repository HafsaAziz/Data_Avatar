In a bid to accelerate its digitization process, the Algerian government is developing a comprehensive roadmap to guide this transformation. High Commissioner for Digitization Meriem Benmouloud announced on Monday that Algeria is set to implement a new digital transformation strategy, with the final draft submitted to President Abdelmadjid Tebboune for approval in June.

This strategy, the first of its kind for Algeria since gaining independence, aims to transition from paper-based to digital management, increase transparency, reduce bureaucracy, broaden access to information, and boost economic performance while maintaining high service quality.

The five-year plan, which concludes in 2029, is built on two main pillars: a forthcoming digitization law and enhanced information and cybersecurity measures. The new law will establish a regulatory framework for the digital sphere, streamline bureaucratic processes, and address technological gaps. The government will collaborate with the Ministry of National Defense to bolster information and cybersecurity.

President Tebboune has championed the digital transformation project as a key driver of sustainable local development. Launched in 2019, the initiative has made significant strides over the past two years, overcoming resource constraints, bureaucratic hurdles, and sector complexities.

According to the latest International Telecommunication Union report, Algeria’s ICT development has seen significant acceleration. The country climbed 14 places in the ICT Development Index, now ranking 88th out of 169 nations. Algeria’s score of 77.8 points surpasses the averages for Africa (47.4), the Arab region (74.5), and middle-income countries (62).
