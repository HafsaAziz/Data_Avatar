This overarching strategy aims to position the country as a key player in the field of Al by developing its human resources, fostering research and innovation, promoting international collaborations, ensuring effective data governance, and advocating for the ethical use of technology.

In addition to these strategic priorities, the nation plans to implement several concrete projects to apply artificial intelligence in key sectors of its development. These projects include initiatives in healthcare, education, agriculture, fishing, transport, energy and defense, highlighting the use of Al to address crucial issues.

In healthcare, Al will enable early disease detection and monitoring of chronic illnesses. In education, an adaptive platform and teacher tracking system will enhance learning. For agriculture, water management and agricultural yield estimation will be optimized. Fishing will benefit from catch forecasts and marine area monitoring. By integrating Al into transportation, the country advances its digital transformation, unlocking new opportunities and boosting global competitiveness. Additionally, using Al to optimize energy production enhances resource efficiency and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. By incorporating Al into its national defense systems, the country proactively safeguards its national interests while bolstering sustainable regional security efforts.

These projects aim to modernize and improve the management of resources and essential services for Mauritania's sustainable development.

# 3 CONTEXT
## WHAT IS AI?

[OECD Logo]
OECD
An Al system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. Different Al systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment. OECD

[United Nations Logo]
United Nations
Al brings enormous benefits to the digital era, but it can also signifi- cantly compromise the safety and agency of users worldwide. Enhanced multi-stakeholder efforts on global Al cooperation are needed to help build global capacity for the development and use of Al in a manner that is trust- worthy, human rights-based, safe and sustainable, and promotes peace. UN Secretary General

AI SYSTEMS CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO TWO BROAD CATEGORIES:

[Image of a human head silhouette with circuit lines inside]
Narrow Al (Weak Al): This type of Al is designed to perform a specific task or a narrow range of tasks. Examples include voice recognition systems, recommendation algorithms, image recognition software, and autonomous vehicles. Narrow Al systems excel in their specific tasks but do not possess general intelligence or consciousness.

[Image of a microchip with "AI" in the center and circuit lines emanating from it]
Al
General Al (Strong Al): General Al refers to machines that exhibit intelligence like humans across a wide range of tasks and domains. These hypothetical systems would have the ability to understand and learn from diverse experiences, apply knowledge to new situations, engage in complex reasoning, and demonstrate creativity. General Al remains an ongoing subject of research and development.

# 3 CONTEXT
## 3.2. CURRENT SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY
The country stands at a crucial crossroads in its technological and economic development, as evidenced by its scores in key indices such as the EGovernment Development Index (EGDI), the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), and the Global Innovation Index (GII). With an e-Gov score of 0.31 in 2022, placing the nation at 172 out of 193 evaluated countries, Mauritania demonstrates untapped potential in the field of e-governance. Similarly, its GCI score of 18.94 in 2022 and its ranking at 133 highlight the need to strengthen cybersecurity. Regarding innovation, the country presents a score of 13.52 in the 2023 GII, ranking 127, indicating a need for impetus in the field of innovation. In the Government Al Readiness Index 2022, published by Oxford Insights, the nation scored 19.37, ranking 150 out of 181 countries, underscoring significant opportunities for growth in integrating Al into public services.

These figures highlight the importance for the country to quickly integrate into the world of artificial intelligence (AI). By strengthening its capacity in e-government, fortifying cybersecurity measures, and innovation, the nation can create an environment to the adoption and effective utilization of Al. Al offers significant opportunities to improve government services, fortify cybersecurity measures and encourage innovation in various sectors. Therefore, by leveraging Al, the country can accelerate its economic and technological development and advance its position on the international stage at the same time.
