This strategy reaffirms the firm belief of Egypt in the investment in responsible and safe AI that serves the public good, protects people's rights and safety, and drives socio-economic development.

To this end, Egypt is adopting its second edition of the National AI Strategy, which aims to realize the following vision:

■ Inclusive AI to foster Digital Egypt, promoting social and economic development and benefiting all Egyptians.

■ National foundational model as a basis to drive industry development and regional cooperation, making Egypt a leader in AI in Africa and the Arab region and an active international player.

The mission statement emerging from this vision is to:

"Create an AI industry supported by governance, technology, data, infrastructure, ecosystem, and talents, to ensure its sustainability and competitiveness for purposes of promoting Egypt's development."

To achieve the vision and mission above, Egypt has identified six strategic objectives to drive socio-economic development, prosperity, innovation, and sustainable development:

1. Ensure ethical and responsible AI use by establishing a comprehensive AI regulatory system, activate the ethical framework, and put a nucleus for a clear regulatory body, actively contributing to global efforts and playing an active role in AI different international fora.

2. Enhance quality of life and sectoral efficiency through AI applications

3. Ensure data accessibility and sharing by developing frameworks for national data governance and strengthening life cycle management of domestic data.

4. Build a robust scalable AI infrastructure and cloud services, innovate business models, and create a good digital foundation for the development of the AI industry with the support of infrastructure development

5. Create a healthy AI ecosystem by supporting local startups, small and medium enterprises, and innovation efforts, and strengthening the investment of venture capital institutions in Egypt.

6. Strengthening the quantity and quality of local AI talents and experts.

By achieving these strategic objectives, Egypt will realize its anticipated strategic goals:

■ By 2030, the ICT sector can contribute to Egypt's GDP by 7.7%¹.

■ 26% of Egypt's workforce that is considered a marginal population would benefit from AI tools and applications²

■ As AI technology develops, 36% of the general public will have access to AI and AI-powered products in their daily lives in 5 years³.

■ The number of AI professionals/experts is expected to reach 30,000 by 2030.

■ Enable and support the establishment of 250+ successful AI companies in Egypt.

■ AI technology, including generative AI, could help accelerate academic research to double the current number of AI publications to reach 6000 publications per year, establishing Egypt as a regional research cooperation center.

Six pillars have been identified to achieve the strategic objectives and strategic goals of the strategy. "Governance" comes as the first pillar to ensure the safe and ethical use of AI. The "Technology" pillar focuses on the use of large language models and AI algorithms to maximize and leverage the benefits of AI for specific industries and use cases. "Data" is considered the fuel of AI algorithms from training data sets to policies for data sharing and data privacy. The fourth element of AI is definitely the "compute infrastructure", ensuring that we can rely on the right compute infrastructure to be able to develop the applications needed by the country.

In addition to achieving the AI regulatory framework and developing the basic elements of AI (AI models, data, and compute infrastructure), the government aims to cultivate the right "talents" and capabilities at all societal levels and to support the Egyptian "Ecosystem", and the AI industry, to gain international competitiveness.

A quick look at some investment indicators in the field of Al in leading countries reveals that these nations early recognized the reality that achieving a competitive advantage in Al is the path to progress, a fact that meant that the new global race is a race to equip themselves with emerging technologies, with Al at the forefront.

Global aspects in this regard were manifested in:

- Countries race to formulate their national Al strategies for artificial intelligence, starting from Canada in 2017, followed by more than 60 other countries, according to the OECD AI Policy Observatory.
- Additionally, the number of agreements between countries for cooperation in this relatively new field is increasing exponentially.
- The global Al market size was valued at USD 515.31 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to USD 2,740.46 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of 20.4% during the forecast period1. Another estimate suggests that the market will reach USD 4,726.6 billion by 2033, with a CAGR of 38.1% from 2024 to 2033. The market for Al technologies is expected to grow from around USD 200 billion in 2023 to over USD 1.8 trillion by 2030⁶.

- While overall Al private investment decreased in 2023, funding for generative Al sharply increased. The sector attracted USD 25.2 billion in 2023, nearly nine times the investment of 2022 and about 30 times the amount in 2019. Generative Al accounted for over a quarter of all Al-related private investment in 2023⁷.
- In 2024, the proportion of research papers focused on Al topics has seen a significant increase. According to the Al Index Report, Al-related research papers now account for approximately 6.3% to 17.5% of all scientific publications, depending on the specific area of Al⁸.
- Al has taken a prominent position on the agendas of international organizations, with each addressing aspects that intersect with its area of expertise.
- Large models catalyze Al development and reset the market landscape of Al, bringing all players on the same playing field again. Countries may exert Al-Generated Content (AIGC) as a tool to take the lead again in Al. AIGC development is accelerating, and the computing power has multiplied exponentially in the last 5 years.

Fig 8: Graph - Outlook for short, medium, and long-term implementation effects

# 9. Conclusion and Next Steps
Egypt places significant emphasis on the advancement of Al, as seen in the government's robust financial and policy backing for Al technologies. Egypt is steadily building a strong basis for the advancement of Al, from creative R&D to increasing investment. Egypt has made great strides toward establishing an environment that is favorable to the development of Al, as evident in its vision, governance, digital capabilities, and data accessibility. These developments have not only increased Egypt's standing in the global Al community but have also drawn more investment from both domestic and foreign sources and bolstered the growth of the regional technology sector.

The roadmap for further development has been laid out, and the Egyptian government intends to initiate a new phase of its "National Al Strategy." Egypt is anticipated to grow into a significant hub for the development of Al in the Middle East and Africa. The strategy aims to further solidify Egypt's status as a regional Al hub.

We suggested the Capacity Assessment Framework (CAF) approach as a way to thoroughly evaluate Egypt's capacity for Al development. To begin, a thorough and methodical analysis of the worldwide Al indices has been performed, such as the OECD Digital Government Index, Stanford University's HAI worldwide Al Index, the Government Al Readiness Index, and Tortoise Media's Global Al Index. Thus, attention must be given to 89 critical indicators. Secondly, to ascertain the goals, prospects, and obstacles of Al development in Egypt, we conducted investigations with important government, industrial, and academic stakeholders. Moreover, Egypt has carried out comparative studies on several nations—China, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Brazil—that have led the way in Al development.

Given the developments in cloud computing, big data, and Al, Egypt has a promising future for Al growth with continued investment and strategy implementation across 21 initiatives across governance, technology, data, infrastructure, ecosystem, and talent. Cloud computing facilitates the rapid development and application of Al. Besides, Al requires enormous data sets. Egypt will place a high priority on protecting its data resources, especially by keeping data inside its borders and preventing it from leaving the nation. In this approach, the country will benefit from investments in local data infrastructure, from Al applications generating new jobs and tax money locally, and from Al applications across a range of industries based on data resources.

Egypt would enhance its international influence, share best practices, and make better use of global resources by fortifying its partnerships with individual nations and international organizations. Egypt's growth in the global Al competitiveness rankings will also reflect its aspirations and accomplishments as a rising digital powerhouse, as it takes a more prominent role in local Al efforts.
