# Introduction

This Artificial Intelligence Strategy is a continuation of Estonia's previous national artificial intelligence strategy implemented in the period of 2019–2021. While at the time of the preparation of the 2019–2021 Artificial Intelligence Strategy, the development of the field was slow and the public sector was just starting to implement its first projects, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has now become an essential and unavoidable part of the development of the digital state. While in 2018, four AI projects had been carried out by four public sector bodies, today more than 80 AI projects have been carried out, more than 40 organisations have been involved, and several open-source AI components have been published, allowing easier implementation by both the private and public sector. In order to achieve the objectives, support was provided to the authorities in the development of AI solutions, a cooperation network was launched, training was provided, and the area of data management and open data was further developed. At the same time, there were no AI-specific activities in the private sector, except for some support for the digitisation and robotisation of services more generally. On the R&D side, the IT Academy's research action, which also includes AI topics, had already been launched, and the Ministry of Education and Research (MER) had strategically been supporting the development of Estonian language technology since 2006. In the area of shaping the legal framework, the 2019–2021 AI Strategy aimed to develop a set of ‘AI laws’ to enable the deployment of AI. As part of this, an intention to develop a regulatory framework on the effects of algorithmic systems was drafted with the aim of identifying possible changes to existing law to accommodate the introduction of AI. Since, after the development of the intention document, the European Union launched an initiative to create a harmonised EU-wide regulation on AI, the legislative activity was redirected towards specific problems that require regulatory intervention independently of the EU action. The budget for the 2019–2021 AI Strategy activities was around 10 million euros.

The current AI Strategy provides an overview of the activities planned to increase the use of AI in Estonia and thereby increase the user-friendliness and accessibility of e-services and the efficiency of the state. In doing so, the AI Strategy includes actions to ensure that the principles of human-centred and trustworthy AI are followed. The strategy addresses the introduction of AI solutions in both the public

and private sector and in education and research, as well as the necessary legislative amendments for 2022–2023, and is largely a continuation of the 2019–2021 strategy. The main objective of the public sector activities is, on the one hand, to support the creation of a base capacity for the deployment of AI solutions in those public sector bodies that have not yet deployed any AI solutions and, on the other hand, to consolidate and empower those bodies that already have basic AI deployment skills but have not yet used them. In addition, 'data as an enabler' is a new stand-alone focus area in this AI Strategy, which aims to support more broadly data findability, reusability, as well as data quality assurance in both the private and public sector. Private sector activities will focus on raising awareness of the potential of AI to add value to businesses and on providing support to those capable companies already willing to develop and test AI-based solutions. From the perspective of education and R&D, there will be a stronger focus on developing competences and skills, continued support for AI R&D, and Estonia will have access to world-class supercomputing resources.

The AI Strategy was set up under the management of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (MEAC), in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice (MJ), and the Ministry of Education and Research (MER). The AI Strategy was supplemented and provided with feedback by the rest of the ministries and the main partner organisations (Estonian Association of Information Technology and Telecommunications, universities, private companies, sub-agencies of the ministries, AI-based consortia of companies and universities, science parks, etc.). The strategy has been established for two years to allow for the necessary response to such a rapidly evolving area. The AI Strategy is an action plan that contributes to the implementation of a number of courses of action arising from several national development plans (including Estonia's Digital Agenda 2030, Research and Development, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy 2035, Education Strategy 2035, etc.). The implementation of the strategy will be managed and monitored on an ongoing basis by a steering group chaired by the MEAC and composed of representatives of public authorities and key partners; it also discusses and plans additional activities, as necessary. Once a year, the implementation of the strategy will be reported to the steering group of the Estonia's Digital Agenda and the

4

***

steering committee of the Research and Development, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy. At the end of the AI Strategy duration period, an analysis of the activities undertaken, and their results will be carried out.

The financial volume of activities included in the strategy reflects the available funding (i.e., covered by the national budget) for the different activities, not the needs. In accordance with this strategy, Estonia will contribute at least EUR 20 million from 2022–2023 to the implementation of the AI Strategy in different focus areas. This will be accompanied by measures to support digitisation more generally in the amount of EUR 100 million, under which, among other things, it will be possible to apply for funding on a competitive basis for AI-related initiatives.

This AI Strategy for 2022–2023 is Estonia's National AI strategy in the sense of the Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence of the European Union.

# AI Strategy for 2022-2023

## Public Sector

**Overview:**
When the drafting of Estonia's National Artificial Intelligence Strategy was started in 2018, public sector organisations had little experience with the implementation of AI solutions, initially limiting themselves to a few projects. Therefore, the aim of the 2019–2021 AI Strategy was to establish the necessary base capacity for Al deployment, gain initial experience, and decide on future actions and targets. In line with the objectives of the strategy, the aim was to measure its implementation by the following key performance indicators (the target levels for the indicators were as of 31 July 2021):

1.  Number of AI solutions deployed in the public sector: 50, baseline: 4
2.  Number of public sector institutions that have deployed AI solutions: 25, baseline: 4
3.  Number of open-source AI components published: 5, baseline: 0

By now, Estonian public sector organisations have gained extensive experience in the use of AI solutions. In the public sector, more than 80 AI projects have been carried out, more than 40 organisations have been involved, and several open-source AI components have been published to facilitate implementation in both the private and public sector. This is illustrated by the current state of implementation of the indicators of the strategy (as of 1 November 2021):

1.  Number of AI solutions deployed in the public sector: 80
2.  Number of public sector institutions that have deployed Al solutions: 40
3.  Number of open-source AI components published: 7

As the implementation of AI solutions has been wide-ranging and involved many public sector bodies, the preparation of the new AI Strategy involved the involvement of almost 50 stakeholders and mapping of existing solutions, challenges, and targets for the

6

implementation of AI solutions and possible measures to support implementation. The following were identified by the organisations as the main challenges and the resulting solutions:

| Challenges | Solutions |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. Expectations from the business side of the application of AI solutions cannot be met with today's level of technology; | 1. Competence and capability; |
| 2. There is a lack of IT support, resources, and commitment to projects; | 1. Competence and capability; 2. Support; |
| 3. Public authorities do not have sufficient support for the development, deployment, and subsequent management of AI solutions; | 1. Support; |
| 4. There is a lack of overview of measures and initiatives to support implementation; | 1. Competence and capability; |
| 5. Organisations lack the competence and experience to assess the quality of data and how to pre-process data; | 1. Competence and capability; 2. Data as an enabler; |
| 6. There is a lack of detailed overview of the solutions, tools, and co-developments that have been made, and the same solutions are being developed; | 1. Central solutions and initiatives; |
| 7. There is a lack of legal certainty about the processing of data, which delays project implementation; | 1. Data as an enabler; 2. Legislative drafting; |
| 8. Not being able to see how to implement AI in the existing information systems and business processes. | 1. Competence and capability; 2. Support. |

7

The aforementioned activities are further sub-divided into public-sector based actions and horizontal private-public cross-cutting actions, the latter of which are separately identified in the ‘data as an enabler' block of activities.

**Strategic objectives:**
Based on the current state of play, the main objective of the strategy in the public sector is, on the one hand, to support the baseline capacity for the deployment of AI solutions in institutions that have not yet deployed AI and, on the other hand, to consolidate and empower institutions that already have the baseline in place today but have not deployed Al systematically. The aim is to apply AI solutions to improve those digital services that are used most and have the biggest impact. In addition, the aim is to introduce human-centred and trustworthy Al principles in the development and implementation of AI solutions in Estonia. In line with the approach provided in the strategy, the aim is to measure its implementation by the following key performance indicators (the target levels for the indicators as of 31 December 2023 are):

1.  Number of AI solutions deployed in the public sector: 130, baseline: 80
2.  Ten of the most used digital services have an AI component: 10, baseline: 0
3.  Number of public sector institutions that have deployed AI solutions: 60, baseline: 40
4.  Number of open-source Al components, source code, and binaries published: 40, baseline: 6
5.  Number of public sector institutions that have deployed the AI-based virtual assistant called Bürokratt: 10, baseline: 0
6.  Number of public services provided through the AI-based virtual assistant called Bürokratt: 15, baseline: 0

8

7.  Speech recognition accuracy in Estonian: 91%, baseline: ~85%
8.  Number of training participants: 1,400

# Private Sector

## Overview:
The Estonian Research and Development, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy 2035 (R&D&I 2035) establishes increasing the R&D and innovation capacity of enterprises as one of its objectives. Among other things, rapid changes in technology, digitisation, and the development of AI are increasing the need for research, development, and innovation (R&D&I) and opening up new opportunities for entrepreneurship. AI and robotics technologies allow companies to streamline in-house processes and supply chain operations, increase the added value of products and services, and ultimately improve their overall competitiveness. One of the focus areas of R&D&I involves digital solutions in every area of life.
While in the period 2019–2021, there were no specific activities in the private sector in the field of AI at the MEAC, with the exception of grants and services for digitalisation and robotisation, and the preparation of the AIRE centre, then, taking into account the needs and challenges identified in the R&D&I, in the coming years, private sector-driven activities on data and AI solutions will focus on raising awareness, developing skills, improving competences, and developing AI solutions. AIRE, the centre for robotics and artificial intelligence, will create an ecosystem and develop an international network in order to support industry in the development and deployment of AI and robotics solutions. Awareness-raising activities in the private sector are planned in 2022, primarily through AIRE. In 2022, the MEAC and the joint agency of Enterprise Estonia (EE) and KredEx will develop a new policy intervention with the SF measures.
Tehnopol Science and Business Park (which is also a member of the consortium) will design development marathons and an accelerator based on its experience and will support large-scale pilot projects based on business needs. In 2022, the Economic Development Department of the MEAC plans to map the needs and challenges of companies in the use of AI solutions even more precisely, and to analyse the best practices of other countries and the possibilities of adapting them to the Estonian context.

19

In addition to AI-specific activities, the joint EE/KredEx agency has launched or is planning to launch support measures and activities for which Al-focused projects can apply/participate in, such as: applied research programme, support for product development, innovation and development shares, business development programme, digitisation grants and activities.

## Strategic objectives:
The key performance indicators for the private sector are (the target levels for the indicators as of 31 December 2023 are):
1. Number of companies participating in digital maturity assessments (number of assessments, assessed by the AIRE EDIH network once a year, partly recurrent): 180
2. Assessment of the feasibility of AI and robotics solutions in enterprises: 150
3. Number of demo projects carried out in AI and robotics: 27 demo projects
4. Number of AIRE EDIH network companies' employees who have participated in training sessions: 450
5. Supporting the development of AI-based pilot projects: 6–8 pilot projects
6. Number of teams that have completed the AI accelerator programme: 10

# R&D and Education

## Overview:
In the period 2019–2021, seven research areas were supported through the IT Academy's research action in cooperation between the state, entrepreneurship, and the academy, of which about half, amounting to EUR 4.5 million, were related to AI, data science, and automation. The IT Academy also supported the development of non-ICT electives in AI, with around half of the curriculum development projects related to AI. The NUTIKAS measure allocated more than EUR 6 million for 25 applied research projects carried out in partnership between businesses and research institutions. From the perspective of infrastructure, Estonia's accession to the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking and the LUMI consortium is an important development, as a result of which Estonian research institutions and companies have access to world-class supercomputing resources from 2022.

In the new period, there will be a greater emphasis on competence and skills. The Education Strategy 2035 sets as one of its strategic objectives to match learning opportunities to the evolving needs of society and the labour market. Information and communication technology (ICT), which is represented as a priority area in the Estonian Research and Development, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy (R&D&I 2035) in the form of the focus area ‘Digital solutions in all areas of life’, is an area in need of priority development in society, which is integrated into general, vocational, and higher education through various measures. AI has a significant role to play in today’s ICT environment, and one question is where the state needs to intervene and ensure that AI-related issues are addressed separately, and where self-regulation is sufficient.

R&D activities in the field of ICT, which fall outside the main instruments for research funding, are mainly targeted and funded through the IT Academy research measure. The role of R&D, both now and in the future, is to take our knowledge in these areas further so that Estonia's higher education, research, business, and wider society reap the maximum benefits.

develop the possibilities of language technology to the next level, as one of the guarantees of the existence of a small culture is whether we can communicate in Estonian with our devices and numerous services. The role of scientific infrastructure, in this case high-performance computing (HPC), is to provide the technical capacity and skills to develop AI.

**Strategic objectives:**
The activities in the field of education are mostly in the planning phase and the corresponding metric will be specified during or by the end of the period, so the main metric to look at initially would be the volume of R&D activities in the field of AI, which at the time of the adoption of the strategy is estimated at EUR 1.5 million per year, with the aim that this level will not decrease.

# Data as an enabler

## Overview:
The lack and insufficient quality of the data are major obstacles to the launch and development of AI projects. Data therefore plays a vital role in the development of AI. For projects to succeed, it is necessary to ensure that data is available in a machine-readable format. When the drafting of Estonia's National Artificial Intelligence Strategy was launched in 2018, open data had been made public few times and the maturity of the field was low. Today, more than 100 institutions have made open data public, and open data is increasingly being used in the development of AI. In order to support the development of AI and to support the sustainable development of Estonian language technology, further measures are needed to develop data management and to increase the disclosure of open data.

## Strategic objectives:
Building on the current state of play, the aim is to support institutions to increasingly disclose open data, to improve data discoverability and use, and to ensure data quality. In line with the approach provided in the strategy, the aim is to measure its implementation by the following key performance indicator (the target levels for the indicators as of 31 December 2023 are):
1. Number of open data disclosed in the portal: 1800, baseline 709

# Legal framework

## Overview:
In the area of shaping the legal framework, the 2019–2021 AI Strategy aimed to develop a package of the ‘AI laws’ to enable the deployment of AI. As part of this, an intention to develop a regulation on the effects of algorithmic systems (the so-called ‘AI VTK’) was drafted with the aim of identifying possible changes to existing law to accommodate the introduction of AI. As the European Commission presented an initiative in April 2021 for an EU-wide regulation on artificial intelligence (AI), the legislative activity has been redirected towards solving specific problems that need to be regulated and can be regulated independently of EU action. In particular, this has meant drafting an amendment to the Administrative Procedure Act, which introduces the conditions for the issuance of automatic administrative acts and provides for additional formal requirements for the processing of personal data in administrative proceedings.

## Strategic objectives:
During the period covered by this strategy, the procedure for amending the Administrative Procedure Act is planned to be finalised. Alongside this, the main legislative activity is active participation in the drafting of legislation and instruments of the European Union and the Council of Europe regulating AI, in order to protect Estonia's interests in the development of a pan-European legal framework. The focus of these initiatives is to regulate the development and use of AI in a human-centred and trustworthy way, i.e., in a reliable, ethical, and lawful way that respects fundamental rights, as well as to establish a set of rules on civil liability related to AI.
