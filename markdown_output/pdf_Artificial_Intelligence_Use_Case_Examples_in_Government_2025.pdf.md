# Scribe Personalized Correspondence Support

## Problem/Opportunity
Cafcass social work staff produced around 80,000 letters monthly to families, which needed personalization but manual editing from templates was time-consuming. This often meant children didn't receive personalized letters, impacting their understanding of significant life events, and the organization's vision of an exceptional experience.

## Solution
An integrated extension to their case management system, called Scribe, was introduced to assist with letter writing. Scribe creates personalizations based on the child's age and data from the file or social worker prompts, then presents the letter for review and edits. It is built on Azure Al services and can produce audio and machine-translated versions.

# Missing Person Alert

## Problem/Opportunity
Families in the region needed a fast, accessible tool to report missing persons without bureaucratic barriers in the early hours of a disappearance. The State Secretariat of Military Police saw an opportunity to share information with the police before a disappearance happens, which would enable faster response times.

## Solution
A new feature was developed in the 190RJ app that allows users to pre-register family members with personal information and photos. In case of disappearance, the photo is sent directly to the police's facial recognition system, which is integrated with the emergency dispatch platform, automatically generating an incident for patrol unit deployment. Any positive identification through cameras automatically triggers a real-time incident, sending a patrol unit to assist.

# Management System for Soil and Water Conservation

## Problem/Opportunity
The application process for soil and water conservation treatment in New Taipei City was paper-based, slow and inefficient, creating a high administrative burden and contributing to carbon emissions. This made it difficult for the Agriculture Bureau to effectively manage an oversee slope land development cases.

## Solution
To combat these challenges, they developed a cloud-based platform with API integration and modular design to digitize the entire case management process for soil and water conservation, including application, review, maintenance and violation reporting. The platform uses a high-performance web framework for multi-device compatibility, incorporates GIS technology for visualizing site-specific data, and features automated alerts trough LINE bot and email to keep users informed about case status and deadlines.

## Key Technologies Used
*   Data & Analytics
*   Cloud
*   Software/Platform/App
*   API
*   Cybersecurity
*   Sustainability Technology

## Agriculture Bureau, New Taipei City Government, Republic of China New Taipei City, Taiwan

New Taipei City Government

## Outcomes

*   **Cost Savings:** NT$5.04 million in Banqiao generated annually
*   **Efficiency:**
    *   1 second to retrieve case status compared to 1-3 days previously
    *   50% increase in administrative efficiency, taking under 100 days for government review times compared to 224 days previously
*   **Environmental Impact:**
    *   500,000 A4 sheets of paper saved
    *   9,450kg of CO2 emissions annually

> “Previously, case handling was paper-based with no transparency or real-time tracking. Now, users track cases through a unified, traceable online interface that shows project stages and responsibilities.”

# Digital Health Wallet

## Problem/Opportunity
In Thailand, public healthcare rights are centralized at hospitals, leaving 47 million UCS beneficiaries facing 4–6 hour waits for minor ailments. Meanwhile, 20,000 pharmacies were not connected to the system. The opportunity was to decentralize access through the Health Wallet feature in the Pao Tang app, turning public benefits into everyday healthcare.

## Solution
The initiative redefined healthcare convenience via the Health Wallet Feature in Pao Tang's app, which integrates an Al symptom checker. Users can assess symptoms and receive instant guidance to nearby participating pharmacies for free medications. Built on real-time data exchange, the platform enables seamless claims and entitlement verification. Public hospitals benefit from reduced congestion and rural communities gain more equitable access.

## Key Technologies Used
*   Cloud
*   Data & Analytics
*   Generative Al
*   Large Language Models (LLM)
*   Software/Platform/App
*   API

## Krungthai Bank PCL Bangkok, Thailand

## Outcomes
*   **Users Served:** Over 280,000 users served in just three months
*   **Pharmacies Doubled:** Participating pharmacies went from 2,000 to 4,000
*   **Wait Times Cut:** Dropped from 4-6 hours at hospitals to under 20 minutes

> “This initiative has transformed how citizens access basic care making it faster, more convenient and closer to home.”

# Declassifying Diplomatic Cables With Al

## Problem/Opportunity
The volume of diplomatic cables requiring declassification review is projected to increase from 100,000 to 650,000 per year by 2031, surpassing unaided human review capacity. A pilot program showed Al could decrease human labor, prompting full deployment to gain efficiencies and identify expansion opportunities.

## Solution
The pilot program was fully implemented for the 2024 work requirement, adding additional technology capabilities. The process implemented topic modeling using Large Language Models to understand context and cluster similar cables, identified novel topics for human decision and improved training of the primary review model.

## Key Technologies Used
*   Artificial Intelligence (AI)
*   Data & Analytics
*   Automation
*   Large Language Models (LLM)

## U.S. Department of State Bureau of Administration Shared Knowledge Services Washington, DC
