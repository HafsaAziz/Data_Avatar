The National Artificial Intelligence Strategy in Lebanese Industry (2020-2050) provides a detailed framework for integrating AI into Lebanon’s industrial sector to achieve technological advancement and sustainable economic growth. The strategy builds upon its Integrated Vision for the Lebanese Industrial Sector, which was introduced in 2015 as part of a broader initiative to modernise and enhance Lebanon’s industrial capabilities.

The strategy is grounded in the principles of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, recognising AI as a transformative tool capable of reshaping industries. It envisions an industrial sector that excels in research and development, applies AI effectively, and produces innovative, smart, and competitive products. This vision is accompanied by a mission to foster innovation and create an environment conducive to the adoption and advancement of AI across various sectors.

Strategic objectives of the strategy include:

The strategy emphasises transforming the Ministry of Industry into a ‘smart ministry.’ This transformation involves digitising operations, creating advanced information systems, and establishing an AI-driven platform to enhance services.

The strategy also outlines the operational pillars for achieving its goals. These include raising awareness and developing human capacities in AI, encouraging research and innovation, fostering public-private partnerships, and creating a supportive regulatory and ethical framework. It also stresses the importance of expanding markets for smart industrial exports, promoting investment in cutting-edge AI technologies, and ensuring effective collaboration with international bodies to exchange expertise and technologies.

The implementation tools for this strategy range from introducing AI-focused education and training programs to encouraging entrepreneurship in AI applications. Policies are also proposed to create favourable conditions for research and innovation while addressing infrastructural challenges, legal frameworks, and cultural attitudes toward AI.

- Adapting to the fourth industrial revolution: Encouraging scientific research, development, and innovation in AI to modernise Lebanon’s industrial landscape while increasing research centers and skilled personnel in this field.
- Promoting economic growth and addressing trade imbalances: Strengthening the industrial sector’s contribution to GDP, expanding both domestic and international markets, and creating employment opportunities for young Lebanese talent.
- Aligning with sustainability goals: Implementing the SDGs related to industrial growth and development from 2030 to 2050 to ensure environmentally friendly and economically viable production practices.
- Enhancing competitiveness and security: Leveraging AI to improve production quality and efficiency, making Lebanese products more competitive while securing industrial and technological sovereignty.
