# about Estonia

Estonia is an innovative nation in Northern Europe known for its digital ambitions. Thanks to smart e-solutions created here, it takes only a few hours to start a company and minutes to declare taxes. The nation is in the top countries in Europe in terms of start-ups per capita. According to Atomico's latest State of European Tech report 2024, Estonia is a global leader in venture capital investment relative to GDP.

However - there's a lot more to discover! Since 2022, Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, has been recognized as a UNESCO City of Music, highlighting its rich musical heritage. At the same time, despite forests covering nearly half of Estonia, the country remains a highly digital society, with almost 90% of households having broadband access.

# Estonia is wired for the future

Estonia is a digital society where efficiency is paramount. For me, e-Estonia means an efficient Estonia. As a compact yet dynamic nation, we have embraced digitalisation as a way of life, driven by a commitment to excellence and a demand for high-quality services. This relentless pursuit of "more" is not only about continuous innovation— though that remains crucial-but also about delivering superb, user-friendly experiences that meet the evolving expectations of our citizens and businesses.

## Digital security
Leading a digital lifestyle underscores the importance of security. We recognise that our digital infrastructure must be robust and resilient to safeguard the interests of all users. This focus on security ensures that Estonia remains the best business environment for entrepreneurs, where e-Estonia epitomises entrepreneurial Estonia.

## Personalised services
We optimise private citizen and business services through enhanced user experiences and proactive engagement. This approach, which we call building a personal state, ensures that services are not only accessible but also intuitive and responsive to individual needs.

## Sustainable innovation
Innovation is ingrained in our way of life. Estonia's tradition of sustainability is not merely a trend but a core value deeply woven into our cultural fabric. We strive to harmonise technological advancement with environmental stewardship, ensuring our progress benefits our people and the planet. By 2030, Estonia aims to be a global leader in sustainability, leveraging our digital prowess to support a harmonious balance between technology and nature. Our companies initiate this shift, embedding eco-conscious principles into their operations and setting new standards for responsible development. For Estonians, sustainability and efficiency go hand in hand, guiding our actions today to safeguard the well-being of future generations.

# Our credo: We constantly seek and develop new digital solutions that allow things to get done faster, better, and cheaper

This is how a successful digital society was built in Estonia, and it's the way we intend to continue. Right now, we are working, for example, on making public services work invisibly, aka proactively in the background for a seamless user experience. We have a wide programme for Al adoption going on — we see the future in Al-powered government. We will be restarting and rebuilding several digital systems, architecture and infrastructure to prevent them becoming a legacy in the next years.

We have built a digital government and society from scratch, and so can you. Today, Estonia has shared its e-governance journey with more than 100 governments that follow our example and employ the competence of our experts, and tech companies. If you want to see how a truly successful digital society works close-hand, do come to Estonia — or start by checking out e-estonia.com. Our private companies, experts as well as government officials are happy to share our digital know-how and solutions to make the world more efficient and simply a better place.

# our success story – 100% digital

Over two decades ago, when Estonia began building its information society, no digital data was collected about citizens, and most people lacked internet access or the necessary devices. Choosing to invest in IT solutions and embrace digitalization required bold vision and determination. Today, Estonia is one of the world's most advanced digital societies. Here are some of the key e-solutions that made it possible.

## Principles of Estonian e-governance:
- **Decentralisation** – There's no central database and every stakeholder, whether a government department, ministry, or business, gets to choose its own system
- **Interoperability** – All system elements exchange data securely and work smoothly together
- **Integrity** - Data exchanges, M2M communications, data at rest, and log files are, thanks to KSI blockchain technology, independent and fully accountable
- **Open platform** – Any institution may use the infrastructure and it works as an open source
- **No legacy** - Continuous legal change and organic improvement of the technology and legislation
- **Once-only** - Data is collected only once by an institution, eliminating duplicated data and bureaucracy
- **Transparency** – Citizens have the right to see their personal information and check how it is used by the government via log files

# ongoing projects and an ambitious future

Successful countries must embrace experimentation. Estonia's journey to becoming one of the world's most advanced digital societies has been shaped by continuous innovation, learning from challenges, and pushing boundaries. The next natural step in e-Estonia's evolution is making essential services fully digital—where processes happen automatically and seamlessly, almost invisibly, ensuring an effortless experience for citizens.

To remain an innovative, effective, and successful Northern European country that leads by example, Estonia must continue executing its vision of becoming a secure e-state with seamless, 24/7 automatic e-services.

In pursuit of this, the Estonian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications has developed the Digital Agenda 2030—a strategic vision and action plan for leveraging digital technology to advance the Estonian economy, state, and society over the next decade.

The agenda aims to enhance satisfaction with digital public services, ensure high-speed, reliable, and affordable internet access for all, and maintain a safe and trustworthy cyberspace.

solutions continues to grow—both in Estonia and globally—the need for action has become clear.

With the help of advanced digital tools, environmental monitoring has become more efficient, enabling Estonia to take a data-driven approach to reducing the ecological impact of its digital infrastructure. The country is now exploring ways to minimize this footprint and set an example as a pioneer in green, environmentally friendly digital governance.

Estonia is the first country in the world to offer e-Residency—a government-issued digital identity that enables nearly anyone, anywhere to establish and manage an EU-based company entirely online.

for driving global economic growth by democratizing access to entrepreneurship and e-commerce. As the concept evolves, we believe countries will increasingly compete for e-residents based on the quality of their public e-services and the strength of their business environment.

## Data Embassy: Ensuring Digital Continuity
Estonia’s Data Embassy is an extension of the government’s infrastructure in the cloud, allowing the state to own and control server resources beyond its territorial boundaries. This is a groundbreaking approach to handling state information, as most countries store their data within their physical borders.

The Data Embassy is safeguarded with KSI blockchain technology, ensuring resilience against cyberattacks and crisis situations. More than just a backup, it can also operate Estonia’s most critical digital services when needed. Our Tier 4 facility—the highest level of security for data centers—is located in Luxembourg, where Estonia and Luxembourg are pioneering a new model for global digital continuity.

Our data embassy is located in Luxembourg under a Tier 4 level of security – the highest level for data facilities. In this collaboration, Luxembourg and Estonia are pathfinders in creating a unique and innovative way to ensure digital continuity in the world.

## Life & business event-based and proactive services
Estonia is committed to eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy in public services. The goal is to ensure that as many government services as possible require either a single online interaction with an official—or none at all.

As a truly digital society, Estonia has already taken a major step forward with proactive family and parental benefits. New parents no longer need to apply for benefits; instead, the government automatically proposes the benefits they are entitled to, requiring only a simple confirmation.

However, most public services today still require user initiation. The Digital Agenda 2030 aims to change this by shifting to a fully seamless, life- and business-event-based model. In the future, the state will proactively notify citizens when they need to take action—ensuring services reach people exactly when they need them.

## Personalized Medicine: The Future of Healthcare
Estonia’s next-generation healthcare system is built on data-driven health solutions. With over 200,000 donors in the Estonian Biobank, genome-based analysis is already enabling citizens to understand personal health risks and take control of their well-being.

Estonia was the first country in the world to test and implement blockchain technology at a national level.

Estonia pioneered the interconnection of decentralized state and public sector databases, setting a global standard for secure and transparent digital governance.

## Intelligent transportation
Estonia is piloting on-demand transportation in rural areas to challenge traditional transport models and offer viable alternatives to personal cars. Meanwhile, autonomous delivery robots and couriers are already navigating Estonia's streets, and electric scooters have become a popular mode of transport.

To improve urban living, Estonia is actively testing bicycle-friendly infrastructure, smart city spaces, and car-free zones, creating more sustainable and accessible cities for its residents.

## Cross-border data exchange
As businesses and citizens become more mobile, the need for seamless international e-services is growing. Estonia is at the forefront of this transformation, launching a cross-border public sector data exchange with Finland in 2017.

The vision? To make secure, real-time data exchange possible across all European countries, eliminating red tape and streamlining the movement of people and businesses.

## Artificial Intelligence strategy
Estonia has been a pioneer in integrating Al into various sectors, with national strategies implemented during 2019–2021 and 2022–2023. Building upon these foundations, the National Al Strategy for 2024–2026 aims to further enhance Al adoption across public services, the private sector, and education. The strategy emphasizes a human-centric and trustworthy approach to Al development, ensuring that advancements are secure, equitable, and respect privacy and human rights. A significant investment of at least €85 million is planned for this period to support these initiatives.

Collaboration between the government, academia, and the private sector remains central to Estonia's Al strategy, fostering innovation and ensuring a cohesive approach to Al development and deployment. Enhancing Al and digital literacy among the population is a key component, ensuring that citizens are well-informed and can actively participate in the digital society. The strategy also focuses on developing and implementing trustworthy Al solutions, ensuring that the benefits of Al are realized in a manner that is secure, equitable, and respectful of privacy and human rights.

One of the flagship projects under this strategy is Bürokratt, an Al-based interface designed to provide voice-based interaction with public services. From the user's perspective, it functions as a single, unified channel for accessing direct and informational public services, elevating the user experience to a new level.

According to Global Cybersecurity Index 2024 Estonia is among most secure countries in the World.

## Real-Time Economy
Estonia is leading the way in building a Real-Time Economy (RTE)—an ecosystem where financial and administrative transactions happen instantly, without delays.

In a fully digital economy, transactions like real-time payments, e-ID verification, e-Invoicing, and e-Receipts operate automatically, reducing costs and boosting efficiency across the European digital single market.

Estonia is already integrating global standards like XBRL GL and GS1, as well as cutting-edge Al and blockchain technologies, to create a truly seamless and interconnected RTE ecosystem.

## Digital transformation in education
In Estonia, digital competence is a core part of the national curriculum, recognized as essential alongside entrepreneurial, social, and civic skills.

The ProgeTiger program has played a pivotal role in shaping Estonia’s digital education, ensuring that students from kindergarten to vocational school have access to high-quality IT education.

While there is no single formula for comprehensive online learning, Estonia’s approach—continuous ICT training for teachers and integration of digital skills in education—equips the next generation with modern, 21st-century competencies.

## Reporting 3.0: Reducing Bureaucracy for Businesses
Estonia is revolutionizing business reporting with Reporting 3.0, an initiative aimed at automating and standardizing mandatory data submissions.

With secure, machine-readable data transfer (XBRL GL format), businesses can now submit financial data directly to government institutions, reducing time-consuming paperwork.

Three key institutions—the Bank of Estonia, the Tax and Customs Board, and Statistics Estonia—have already defined taxonomies to ensure a smooth, standardized reporting process, saving businesses time and resources.

By simplifying reporting, Estonia enables companies to focus on growth and innovation, rather than bureaucracy.

# IT sector
IT plays a central role in Estonian life, driven by strong public trust in digital solutions. The essential e-services that power Estonia's digital society were all developed by local companies, backed by over 20 years of expertise in automating both public and private sector services. Today, nearly all state-related operations can be completed online 24/7—from digital prescriptions to tax declarations, with only a tiny fraction still filed on paper.

Estonia has shared its e-governance journey with over 60 governments and exported its digital solutions to more than 130 countries worldwide. With a bold IT sector and an ambitious start-up community, Estonia continues to develop world-changing innovations—from Skype to e-Residency.
