# Introduction:

In 2016, Egypt launched its first version of the Sustainable Development Strategy: Egypt's Vision 2030, as a cornerstone for a comprehensive developmental process. The national Vision considered national priorities and aspirations to draw a roadmap that achieves sustainable development, meets Egyptian people's dreams and aspirations for a decent and dignified life, and maximizes the benefits from all of the country's potential and capabilities. Egypt's Vision 2030 has provided a clear direction for the country's efforts to achieve sustainable development across its economic, social, and environmental dimensions. It has also informed the government's plans and programs, with a clear focus on inclusive and sustainable growth, as well as balanced government's development.

By 2030, Egypt aims at having a competitive, balanced, and diversified economy, based on knowledge and innovation; to be built on a just, inclusive, and participatory society; with a sustainable and diverse ecosystem. This will pave the way forward towards achieving sustainable development and improving the quality of life for Egyptians, without compromising the rights of future generations.

In light of the global, regional and national changes and challenges witnessed over the past seven years, the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development (MPED) has worked towards updating the first version of Egypt's Vision 2030. The update process took place through a participatory approach that brings together the efforts of all stakeholders and development partners from the government, private sector, and civil society. The process also involved a team of experts, academics, and practitioners from a variety of disciplines. Through a review of the current status of achieving the Vision's goals, and an assessment of the challenges to their implementation, this team identified key drivers for the updating process, as follows:

*   Enhancing the interlinkages and integration between the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social, and environmental. Additionally, implementing the vision -with its strategic and general goals- in a way that is aligned with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063 (Africa Agenda 2063).

• Monitoring the financial, monetary, institutional, and legislative reforms that the state has implemented, and the new opportunities and challenges that have emerged for the Egyptian state in terms of economic, social, and environmental issues. The updated vision hence reflects the results of the first phase of the National Economic and Social Reform Program, and takes into account the second phase that focuses on structural and sectoral reform. Accordingly, it prioritizes high-productivity sectors that are drivers of sustainable growth. It also fosters the mutual benefit of all stakeholders from the development process, by achieving equitable distribution of economic resources and bridging development gaps between governorates.

• Increasing the focus on pressing issues that hold strategic significance. This includes population growth, climate change, water scarcity, etc. The Vision also calls for proactively addressing regional challenges and geopolitical developments on both the regional and international levels, in a manner that safeguards Egypt's security, stability, and peace and uphold Egypt's pioneering role.

• Enhancing Egypt's ability to respond swiftly and effectively to consecutive global challenges, improving forecasting to anticipate any updates on the national, regional and global levels and prepare for any contingencies. In addition to, strengthening the ability of the economy to confront external shocks (for example, the outbreak of COVID-19 and the ensuing global economic downturn).

• Emphasizing the significance of Egypt's Vision 2030 resilience and adaptability, with the objective of enhancing the quality of life for Egyptian citizens whilst guaranteeing inclusive development for all, and leaving no one behind.

In order to fulfill this motivation for an updated Vision, the update process adopted a number of steps defined through a scientific and well-studied roadmap, to reach the final version presented hereby. It began with a review of the Vision's first version by experts in economics, sociology, and environmental science. This review identified key gaps in the first version, which were then

addressed by a team of relevant experts. Concurrently, ministries and national entities developed sectoral strategies and action plans, each in their field of work. The outcomes of these two parallel reviews were then integrated into a national document that included cross-cutting themes and activities.

The final step was to gather the inputs from experts, stakeholders, and development partners on the compiled national document, to synthesize a single strategic document: the updated Egypt's Vision 2030. This document defines a set of «Guiding Principles» that govern the implementation of the «Strategic Goals», as well as a set of «Enablers» that are necessary requirements for implementation mechanisms. It is aligned with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Africa Agenda 2063. It also reflects the national context, taking into account the political, economic, social, and environmental rights guaranteed to all Egyptian citizens by the Egyptian Constitution.

Egypt's 2030 updated Vision is based on Four Guiding Principles to achieve its goals and targets, with a belief that “Human-Centered Development” is key to the success of any development process, and that the Vision's realization will not be possible without achieving "Equity and Accessibility”. Equally, implementation has to be characterized by "Resilience and Adaptation"; ensuring that "Sustainability” is ultimately attained.

The vision also identifies Seven Enablers that are necessary to achieve sustainable development goals effectively and efficiently by 2030. These enablers are “Financing”; “Technology and Innovation”; “Digital Transformation”;“Data Generation and Availability”; “Supportive Legislative and Institutional Environment”; “A Supportive Cultural System”; and “Population Growth Control”.

These guiding principles and enablers represent the overarching umbrella and the tools, indispensable to achieve Egypt's Vision 2030's Six Strategic Goals, which embody the state's aspirations for realizing sustainable development. These strategic goals unfold into 32 general

goals that complement one another and align with the state's priority towards developing the Egyptian citizen. The endeavors to implement the general goals are targeted at accomplishing the strategic goals, and they are outlined as follows:

The first strategic goal, «Improve Egyptians' Quality of Life and Raise their Living Standards» adopts the fundamental components for a decent and dignified life. These include poverty eradication, food provision, access to distinct health services, quality education system, access to adequate housing, and enriching the cultural and sports life of the Egyptian citizens.

As for the second strategic goal, «Social Justice and Equality» aims to reduce the gender gap, provide social protection, and achieve inclusion and equal opportunities, thereby reducing disparities among social groups, especially the most vulnerable and in need, including women, children, youth, persons with disabilities, and the elderly. Additionally, it focuses on promoting spatial and regional development to bridge developmental gaps between geographic regions.

The third strategic goal, «Integrated and Sustainable Environmental System» focuses on adhering to the global development model that emphasizes the preservation and effective management of natural resources, maintaining their biodiversity and preventing their unjust exploitation. It strives to enhance economic growth rates while mitigating the associated air and water pollution and overall asset degradation. Moreover, this goal promotes the adoption of innovative economic models, including circular and green economies, to decouple economic growth from excessive reliance on natural resources, minimize resource waste and consumption, and create new green-collar jobs.

Regarding the economic perspective, the fourth strategic goal «Diversified, Knowledge-based, and Competitive Economy» embodies the economy's capacity to generate revenue, manage resources, and create job opportunities across diverse sectors: industrial, agricultural, and services, while avoiding over-reliance on a single sector and instead promoting balanced

development across all sectors. It also recognizes the need for active involvement of the private sector, alongside the government sector, in fostering effective and integrated participation. This is achieved through improving the business climate, enhancing competitiveness, and formalizing the informal economy. These efforts are part of a broader framework aimed at enhancing labor market efficiency, elevating the skills and proficiency of the Egyptian workforce, boosting competitiveness, fostering innovation, and transitioning towards a cashless society. All of which is supported by the state's national projects, infrastructure, and supportive legislative and institutional environment.

As for the fifth strategic goal, «Well-Developed Infrastructure» recognizes the significance of ensuring basic and adequate services, including energy, electricity, water, and sanitation. It underscores the importance of establishing secure and sustainable transportation systems, be it through the Suez Canal as a waterway, the utilization of electric traction within the railway network, or the development of a comprehensive network of roads, bridges, ports, and airports. Additionally, it entails developing communication and information systems to foster an appealing investment environment that supports public-private partnerships in infrastructure projects, and to construct an advanced industrial base that enhances the competitiveness of the national economy.

The sixth and final strategic goal, «Governance and Partnerships» embodies the comprehensive plan for institutional development under the rule of law. It ensures the participation of all parties in the decision-making process at both the national and local levels, within a legislative and institutional framework that fosters transparency and accountability, thereby combating corruption and improving citizens' services. This entails enhancing human capabilities and promoting a shift in societal culture and administrative behavior. Furthermore, this goal endeavors to uphold overall security and stability while strengthening partnerships between Egypt and various countries, as well as relevant international, regional organizations and development partners.

## 1. Human-Centered Development

Diverse countries face varied challenges in their developmental processes, shaped by the distinct nature of each nation and era. The developmental journey evolves with the different variables, yet it universally revolves around one central principle; that the ultimate goal of development is the well-being of humanity. Therefore, Egypt's Vision 2030 is anchored in a fundamental tenet, with human development at the center.

Consequently, Egypt's Vision 2030 seeks to improve the living standards of all segments of society by ensuring access to quality education, training, and skill refinement necessary for future job prospects grounded in scientific research and innovation, along with providing adequate health insurance.

Egypt's Vision 2030 recognizes that the engine of development is propelled by the citizen, and that development strategies should align with the ambitions and desires of Egyptian citizens. The success of visions is measured by the degree to which every Egyptian reaps the benefits of the development process in an equitable and sustainable manner across all facets of life, irrespective of the divergent approaches employed to achieve the desired objectives, their differing levels across different phases, and the degree to which they align with global and domestic advancements and transformations.

All the strategic goals in Egypt's Vision 2030 are built on the principle of «Human Centered-Development» starting with:

The first strategic goal "Improve Egyptians' Quality of Life and Raise their Living Standards" which aims to eradicate poverty, achieve food security, ensure inclusive healthcare, guarantee the citizens' rights to quality education, provide adequate housing for all, revitalize cultural activities, and enhance cultural participation. It also emphasizes fostering awareness, eliminating all forms of

13

VISION OF EGYPT

# Page 4

intellectual bias and extremism, nurturing a spirit of tolerance, instilling patriotism, and promoting sports by providing necessary resources and capabilities.

The significance of this guiding principle, also, becomes evident in the second strategic goal, “Social Justice and Equality" which seeks to narrow developmental gaps between geographical regions, address social and demographic disparities in resource distribution, and achieve equal opportunities through a framework of justice and fairness for all citizens.

This principle is further affirmed in the third strategic goal, "Integrated and Sustainable Environmental System" by ensuring that each individual's needs of water, air, energy, and mineral resources are met. It involves the conservation of biodiversity, the efficient management of waste, and the protection of natural resources and the environment in a way that upholds equitable utilization and safeguards the rights of future generations.

As for the fourth strategic goal, "Diversified, Knowledge-based, and Competitive Economy" it aims to enhance Egypt's capacity to build a robust economy capable of attaining development by providing decent employment opportunities, generating income, and increasing competitiveness, thereby positively impacting the quality of life for the Egyptian citizen.

The fifth strategic goal, "Well-Developed Infrastructure" underscores the importance of modern infrastructure to stimulate and attract local and foreign investments, ultimately improving the quality of life for people.

The sixth strategic goal, "Governance and Partnerships" targets eliminating corruption, ensuring transparency, progressing towards strengthening international and local partnerships, and guaranteeing citizen participation in decision-making processes concerning development and their well-being at all levels. This involves assigning a bigger role to the private sector, civil society organizations, and associations, alongside the public sector, to enhance the satisfaction of each individual and ultimately benefit the human beings who are at the core of development.

## 2. Equity and Accessibility

One of the biggest and most critical challenges that countries face in achieving their development objectives is ensuring equitable distribution of the benefits of development among their citizens. While the development process may bolster the economy, foster growth rates, and enhance infrastructure, it often falls short of ensuring fair access to services for all citizens.

Egypt's Vision 2030 believes that the desired outcome of the developmental process can only be attained when all segments of the society reap the benefits. As one of the principles guiding this Vision, "Equity and Accessibility" has been selected to ensure the realization of the strategic goals and measure their success based on merit standards and the rule of law.

This crucial guiding principle, "Equity and Accessibility" signifies that all citizens, especially the most vulnerable and in need of care, enjoy all their rights on all levels; political, economic, social, civil, and cultural. This involves ensuring equal opportunities for accessing all public services.

"Equity and Accessibility" involves delivering high-quality educational, training, healthcare, and infrastructure services, along with opportunities for decent and productive employment and social security, in an equitable manner to all segments of society irrespective of income levels, gender, age, or geographical location. This approach enhances efforts to improve the quality of life for Egyptian citizens.

The vision seeks to achieve its strategic goals in a manner that ensures gender equality by empowering women economically, socially, and politically. It also aims to achieve intergenerational equality by providing employment opportunities for youth and integrating persons with disabilities and the most vulnerable. This is accomplished by making various services available to them inclusively, and with high quality.

# 3. Resilience and Adaptability
In the face of rapid changes in various aspects of life, it has become essential for countries to adopt a path characterized by "Resilience and Adaptability", emphasizing the state's ability to confront challenges arising from the impacts of economic fluctuations, natural disasters, pandemics, and climate change. This involves finding alternatives, exploring new solutions to capitalize on available opportunities, and maintaining productivity.

Egypt's Vision 2030, in achieving its strategic goals, relies on a crucial principle enhancing "Resilience and Adaptability". This means the system's capacity to effectively respond to abrupt international and regional shifts or unforeseen local developments; be they economic, political, social, or environmental. It involves anticipating swift and appropriate mechanisms to address issues and providing solutions that mitigate the adverse impacts of shocks or crises, ensuring the continuity of development and production.

When designing the strategic goals, the vision places the principle of "Resilience and Adaptability” as a foundation that supports the level of readiness and raises it in emergencies. Resilience is the ability to face challenges and capitalize on new opportunities by creating a favorable environment for innovation and advancement. Whereas adaptability is linked to anticipating the future and developing scientific scenarios to manage and mitigate crises, providing data and information to identify suitable adaptation options, allowing all segments of society to respond rapidly to emerging conditions, and facilitating their continuous livelihoods, productivity, and employment. Conversely, these measures necessitate bolstering international partnerships to draw from experiences, whether for technical assistance or financing, alongside efforts to encourage private sector involvement due to its rapid adaptability and integration across all productive sectors.

This principle was clearly exemplified when addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, which swept across the globe in record time, causing disruption to all healthcare, economic, and social systems, even

16

affecting robust ones. Egypt managed to effectively address the crisis through the professional utilization of its human and financial capabilities, thus mitigating the catastrophe and overcoming the challenges.

# 4. Sustainability
This principle "Sustainability" stands as a fundamental pillar for comprehensive development across various sectors such as industry, agriculture, communications and information technology, tourism, transportation, logistics, water utilization, renewable energy, and the establishment of new communities and cities.

"Sustainability", in this context, refers to aligning the consumption of natural resources with production goals to enhance people's well-being, applying social justice, and adopting responsible resource management to minimize pollution and protect biodiversity thereby mitigating environmental harm. All of this must be carried out within a robust governance framework that ensures transparency, accountability, and participation, allowing society's needs to be reflected in light of rapid economic progress.

In the execution of the strategic goals, Egypt Vision 2030 adopts this principle; emphasizing meeting present needs while safeguarding the rights of future generations. This involves transitioning towards a green economy, ensuring low-emission economic growth by enhancing resource efficiency and promoting sustainable production and consumption patterns. Additionally, the implementation of a circular economy is encouraged to maximize the utilization of all production outputs, including secondary ones, by resource sharing, recycling, and waste conversion to enhance resource efficiency.

# 1. Financing

## Definition:
Financing is the primary tool for any implementation steps to fulfil the growing development needs. It involves mobilizing financial resources in all their forms, both public and private, domestic and international to serve the targeted goals of the vision.

## Significance:
Securing funding requires a sustainable increase in available resources to better meet the requirements of development. This is achieved by identifying the suitable types of financing for implementing each strategic goal, in accordance with the conditions, changes, and laws governing it, as outlined in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. This agenda adopted a new and binding framework for each country to establish a set of appropriate incentives that facilitate financing in vital areas of development, including social protection (poverty reduction, education, health, adequate food and housing), alongside infrastructure, scientific research, technology, digitization, capacity building, investment, and partnerships with the private sector and international institutions.

Financing sources should not be limited to government expenditure or external funding through loans and official development assistance alone; they should also encompass private sector investments, contributions from civil society organizations, Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), and local banking and non-banking institutions. Additionally, new forms of financing, including innovative financial instruments like green bonds and others, should be explored.

## Current Landscape:
Egypt recognizes the critical importance of financing as a fundamental factor in achieving sustainable development. This was evident in Egypt's second Voluntary National Review (VNR)

21

presented at the United Nations High-Level Political Forum (UN HLPF) in 2018. The report identified financing as a key challenge that could hinder the achievement of the SDGs.

The significance of providing financing became more pronounced after the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a substantial decline in global investments. In response, the Government of Egypt (GoE) implemented a series of stimulus packages to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic on economic activities. Measures included deferring loan repayments for small and micro-projects, waiving certain sovereign fees, as well as expanding social protection networks to include irregular workers. Furthermore, support was extended to the most impacted sectors such as tourism. These measures included the provision of necessary credit facilities to meet the requirements for essential and strategic commodities. Initiatives were launched to finance private sector companies in industrial, agricultural, and contracting fields. Additionally, an initiative was introduced to finance Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) with low-interest rates and favorable terms.

Despite the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of economic reforms since November 2016 have led to a noticeable improvement in various economic indicators, as outlined below:

*   A significant decrease in the total budget deficit as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP), recording 6.1% in 2021/22 [1] compared to 11.5% in 2014/15. [2]
*   A rise in remittances reaching approximately $31.9 billion in 2021/22, reflecting a 65% increase compared to 2014/15. [3]
*   Positive developments in FDIs during 2021/22, resulting in a net volume of around $8.9 billion compared to approximately $6.4 billion in 2014/15. This net foreign investment in non-petroleum sectors included investments for establishing new companies valued at $238.2 million and

investments aimed at increasing corporate capital with $3.2 billion, in addition to incoming transfers for the purchase of properties in Egypt by non-residents totaling $970.3 million, and a net profit from the sale of assets and surplus in receivables amounting to $4.9 billion. The proceeds from the sale of companies and productive assets for non-residents reached $2.3 billion. Looking at the key economic sectors, the services sector accounted for the largest share of net foreign inflows, comprising 68.7% (with the financial sector receiving 23.2% of the total inflows, and other service activities securing 23.8%), followed by the industrial sector, which captured 35.9% of the net foreign inflow.

*   The net international reserves of the Central Bank of Egypt rose to approximately $33.4 billion in 2022 compared to around $20 billion in 2015. [4]
*   The increased confidence of International Financial Institutions (IFIs) as well as bilateral and multilateral development partners in the Egyptian economy which is evident in concessional development financing agreements for diverse public and private sectors.

## Challenges:
Despite the resilience of the macro-economic indicators due to Egypt's effective economic measures, financing for development faces a multitude of institutional challenges that have been intensified by the repercussions of the global lockdown aimed at curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges are exemplified by:

*   The deepening savings gap that grew following the pandemic due to the structural weaknesses in savings rates.
*   Limited FDIs.
*   The difficulties in administrative procedures and the persistence of informal payments.
*   Feeble tax revenues, especially direct revenues.

## Objective:
The aim is for the state to stimulate diverse financing sources, eliminate barriers, and promote unconventional methods to bridge financing gaps, with the objective of realizing Egypt's Vision 2030 within a framework of transparency. It is important to consider the varying levels of ease in channeling different financing sources towards the Vision's goals.

## Key Enabling Policies:
*   Raising the efficiency of mobilizing local financial resources by raising awareness of the importance of saving values, rationalizing expenditure, stimulating the private sector to participate, and improving the tax system, to ensure effective access for all categories of financiers.
*   Utilizing technology and supporting financial inclusion by providing a diverse set of innovative financing tools, integrating all segments of society into the financial system, including the informal sector and those not willing to engage with the traditional banking system.
*   Building strong partnerships and maintaining effective and continuous communication with the private sector and civil society by easing restrictions, reducing bureaucracy, enhancing the business environment, and creating an incentive system supporting the direction of private financing flows toward priorities and national goals.
*   Continuously improving the governance of the administrative and procedural system to secure developmental financing, and maximize the benefits from the available funds.
*   Developing clear policies and mechanisms to support external flows and their mobilization, especially remittances from Egyptians working abroad, and directing them towards development.
*   Reducing reliance on loans in favor of FDIs, helping increase the investment rate, alleviating budgetary pressures, and improving the balance of payments.

## Significance:
Advanced technologies have demonstrated their valuable support to the development dimensions, such as elevating growth rates, increasing investment returns, minimizing production costs, and improving the efficiency of public expenditure. Both global and local technological platforms play a key role in stimulating participatory approaches, supporting administrative reforms, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government agencies, enhancing governance, and achieving stability on both domestic and international fronts.

## Current Landscape:
*   In the Global Knowledge Index, Egypt reached the 53rd position out of 154 countries in 2021 [5], compared to the 72nd position out of 138 countries in 2020. This progress is attributed to the rise in most sector-specific indicators constituting the index, surpassing the global average (pre-university education, higher education, information and communication technology, enabling environment, technical education, and spending on research and development activities).

Ultimately, digital transformation plays a role in reducing transaction costs and enhancing institutional governance. By separating service providers from recipients, it ensures the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery, while also promoting transparency and citizen trust levels.

## Current Landscape:
• Indicators for the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector have improved, leading the sector to maintain its position as the fastest-growing sector in Egypt. The growth rate of the communications sector reached 16% in 2020/21 compared to 15.2% in 2019/20. [6]
• Egypt's ranking improved in the Network Readiness Index for 2021, reaching the 77th position among 130 countries, compared to the 84th position among 134 countries in 2020. [7] The strengths of this index are reflected in the improvement of Egypt's ranking in some of its sub-indicators, as follows:
Egypt ranked 14th in international internet bandwidth, mobile tariffs, and 22nd in digital skills for handling modern technologies. Additionally, Egypt secured the 17th position in active mobile broadband subscriptions.
• Egypt ranked 3rd among the most improved countries in the Digital Inclusion Index for 2020, according to Roland Berger.
• An electronic government services portal has been launched, offering services such as supply, real estate, documentation, civil status, and vehicle licensing.
• The expansion in digital transformation projects and the development of services to citizens have been achieved through the development of technological centers in neighborhoods and cities. By the end of 2022, 311 technological centers out of a total of 341 centers will offer 250 services across public offices in governorates, centers in cities, and neighborhoods, including the development of 250 mobile technological centers.

• Support for e-learning in schools and universities has been strengthened by providing devices, equipment, and programs to develop the necessary infrastructure. This has become especially important following the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift to remote learning and hybrid teaching systems.

## Challenges:
There are several challenges on the path to digital transformation, including the following:
• The digital divide across different geographical regions and certain segments of society, as follows:
- Weak digital infrastructure, especially in remote areas, leading to limited number of users.
- Low income of certain social segments, resulting in limited purchasing powers that prevents them from acquiring smart devices and internet subscriptions.
- Gender disparities in technology usage, affecting women's participation in various technology activities.
- Insufficient computer and internet literacy, resulting in a limited user base and difficulty in handling basic problems, especially among the illiterate.
- Inadequate alignment of digital program and system designs with the actual needs of certain societal groups (such as the elderly, people with disabilities, and those with lower educational levels).
• Insufficient awareness of security and privacy controls on the internet.
• Continued reliance of some government entities on paper transactions, limiting the benefits of digital transformation.
• Inadequate data management strategies, due to the lack of operationalization of the legislation on data security and ownership, as well as infrastructure unpreparedness to recover from network and system disasters in some government institutions.

• Shortage of skilled personnel required for digital transformation, resulting from the migration of digital technology professionals abroad due to low-income levels in the sector compared to other countries in the region.
• Limited availability of e-waste collection and treatment companies, causing difficulties in properly disposing of obsolete servers, storage units, screens, computers, and mobile devices.

# Objective:
The aim is for digital transformation to improve the effectiveness of government institutions in fulfilling the citizens' needs, rendering them more transparent and inclusive, while also offering new tools and opportunities to address crises and surmount developmental obstacles. This entails innovation in production and consumption models, reorganizing economic sectors, introducing new conditions for competitiveness, and reducing transaction costs.

# Key Enabling Policies:
• Developing digital infrastructure across all geographical regions, especially in remote areas.
• Encouraging investments in digital infrastructure to meet present and future demands, and address digital divides.
• Setting clear legislations and regulations to ensure the maintenance of data protection and user privacy.
• Promoting competition mechanisms in information technology markets through effective enforcement of competition principles, limiting monopolistic practices, and economic concentration that restricts freedom of competition.
• Embracing emerging technology companies by providing them with financial and technical support.
• Reducing overall illiteracy rates, especially digital illiteracy, and increasing enrollment rates in all levels of education to equip citizens with essential digital skills.

• Supporting women and persons with disabilities in using communications and information technologies, promoting the use of electronic applications in various fields such as health and education.
• Supporting women in family care and care economics to empower those working in the digital economy to strike a balance between their caregiving responsibilities and digital work.

# 4. Data Generation and Availability
## Definition:
The concept of data generation and availability entails providing information from various sources based on documented and updated data across all domains, enabling its storage and utilization in a manner that allows universal access. This encompasses sustaining the production of studies, analyses, reports, and statistics to facilitate decision-making and the development of present and future directions. Data can be released at two levels: the governmental level, represented by figures and information published by ministries, authorities, and government institutions; as well as the private level, which is made accessible by industry leaders, business owners, civil society, private projects and initiatives for viewing and deriving benefits from.

# Significance:
The availability of data and the frequency of its production are prerequisites for effective management of development in the era of information sharing and the utilization of big data. Projects in various fields rely on the accuracy of available information, enabling proper analysis and the generation of diverse alternatives to address problems. Moreover, this aids decision-makers in formulating policies that can effectively confront the existing challenges.

From an economic perspective, creating a conducive business environment to attract investments and partnerships relies on having accurate knowledge of all the information that determines the competitive advantages of all parties, as well as assessing the impact and measuring performance.

Therefore, data availability is a vital enabler that bolsters monitoring and evaluation systems, facilitating the seamless and efficient attainment of good governance. Consequently, this supports the achievement of all the strategic goals outlined in the Vision.

The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) stands out as the primary partner for producing, gathering, organizing, and availing official data in Egypt, in addition to the specialized data issued by the Central Bank of Egypt, government institutions, the private sector, and civil society.

## Current Landscape:
• Egypt has secured the top position among 9 Arab countries assessed for their reporting and publication mechanisms of national data on sustainable development. Egypt met 50% of the criteria set by Arab National Platforms for evaluating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These criteria include having Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in place to facilitate data usage among government entities and the public, utilizing interactive visual tools for efficient data comprehension and analysis, ensuring data availability in multiple languages, and enabling data downloads.

• MPED launched the integrated system, called "Bayan platform,” for the compilation and calculation of national accounts. This platform collects required data from ministries, entities, and institutions electronically and immediately upon issuance. It adjusts Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data and expedites the calculation process while mitigating certain errors that may arise from manual data entry.
• Egypt developed a comprehensive National Strategy for Development of Statistics, which aims to improve the national statistical system's capacity to generate timely and high-quality statistical data required for the country.
• Efforts have been made to link national databases to unify essential citizen data such as births and deaths records, beneficiaries of subsidies and health insurance, government employees and retirees, civil status, and government facilities...etc.
• A data ecosystem was launched to produce sustainable development indicators. This ecosystem operates through a cohesive national statistical system that adheres to international standards, thereby promoting accessibility to credible and high-quality data. [9]

# Challenges:
The limited availability of accurate and accessible data in a timely manner adversely affect the efficiency of decision-making processes regarding policies aimed at achieving the SDGs. This was emphasized in Egypt's third VNR presented at the UN HLPF in 2021.

The challenge in Egypt extends beyond the mere scarcity of data; it also encompasses:
• The infrequency and inadequate quality of data generation, which hinders its utilization and analysis by experts.
• The constant growth in the volume of required data at the national, regional, and international

levels. This is interconnected with the increased burden of generating multiple number of indicators or the inadequacy of available funding and trained personnel.
• Outdated statistical and data collection legislations.
• Difficulty in coordinating various data due to the existence of a dual system for data production frequency. Some rely on the fiscal year, while others are based on the Gregorian calendar year.
• Weakness in the infrastructure and information technology for monitoring and collecting statistical data, particularly within the government sector.
• Insufficient preparedness to handle big data using conventional data processing applications and the absence of modern advanced platforms that facilitate data collection and utilization.
• Weak geographic information systems and cloud computing, along with the absence of unified definitions for indicators or standardized calculation methods.

# Objective:
The aim is for the state to adopt policies that aid in the development of a robust, comprehensive, and sustainable statistical system, ensuring the generation and availability of data, and capitalizing on the support offered by financial institutions and international organizations to reinforce data systems, as well as foster coordination mechanisms between data producers and data users.

# Key Enabling Policies:
• Supporting collective work and cooperation among all statistical data producers and organizations concerned with data availability.
• Enacting a law for data provision for the purpose of scientific research and development.
• Updating legislations related to data production and accessibility, and improving the information

infrastructure to monitor data and link between government databases.
• Enhancing capacities and skills in data handling and utilizing advanced systems.
• Involving specialized national experts in generating estimates for various indicators (economic, social, environmental, etc.) using approved statistical models.
• Facilitating effective coordination and collaboration between national statistical systems and international organizations to enhance data availability and ensure good governance.

# 5. Supportive Legislative and Institutional Environment

## Definition:
A supportive legislative environment refers to the role played by parliamentary councils in enacting legislations related to development goals. It also involves the parliamentary oversight over the executive authority's activities and the overall performance of the state, to ensure the proper implementation of these laws.

## Significance:
In order to achieve the strategic goals of the Vision, several policies and procedures require legislative and procedural adjustments. This may involve directing public spending towards specific sectors to improve citizens' quality of life, introducing incentives and privileges in other sectors to empower women, supporting environmentally friendly behaviors, achieving spatial justice, or addressing conditions or decisions that do not support development and require facilitation or liberation to encourage investment. It may also involve supporting fair competition policies, increasing efficiency, and creating job opportunities.

# Current Landscape:
• The Egyptian Parliamentary Councils have accumulated considerable experience, being one of the oldest councils in the Middle East with a history spanning over 150 years. The first Parliamentary Council in Egypt was established in 1866 (the “Advisory Council of Representatives"), enabling parliamentarians to communicate with citizens and gain insights into local development needs, and affording them the expertise to engage in constructive discussions and approve development legislations.
• Harmony between the Parliament and the Government to avoid institutional disputes between the legislative and executive authorities when approving laws and enacting legislation, as stipulated in the Egyptian Constitution of 2014 and its amendments.
• The Egyptian Parliament has robust oversight tools that empower it to hold the Government accountable, enabling it to fulfill its role in improving the public sector performance.
• Revitalizing the “ERRADA” initiative, which is a unit under the presidency of the Council of Ministers pursuant to the Prime Minister Resolution No. 998 of 2019. It aims to contribute to reforming the legislative and procedural system regulating the business environment, as well as building a legislative impact assessment system to support decision-makers in regulating the practice of economic activities. This is in addition to building a mechanism for consultation and societal dialogue with the concerned parties outside the decision-making process, to take into account different viewpoints when drafting new legislations or addressing legislative disparities.

## Challenges:
Although the Parliament monitors the government's performance, and development laws and legislations are approved in a timely and adequate manner, there are a number of challenges, namely:

37

• The obsolescence and contradiction of some legislations. This is a challenge faced by a country such as Egypt, which has a legislative legacy in which a number of laws date back to the 19th century, leading to the obsolescence of some laws as a result of social, economic, and political changes. This is in addition to the cultural changes accompanying the technological revolution, which renders old laws inefficient in achieving justice.
• Inadequate societal dialogue and communication regarding new laws; limiting the positive impact of legislations and complicating its implementation.
• Insufficient data, information, and technical studies available to parliamentarians, especially when reviewing proposed legislations from the executive branch or suggesting amendments, as well as evaluation studies of the effectiveness and efficiency of existing legislations.

## Objective:
The aim is to build a legislative framework to support sustainable development efforts with the speed and efficiency necessary to improve performance and review all laws, implementing regulations, and ministerial decisions issued, to achieve structural reform, regulate the practice of economic activities, create a business climate, and support fair competition policies.

## Key Enabling Policies:
• The Parliament as a Partner in Responsibility contributes to development by efficiently representing citizens' demands and scrutinizing development-related parliamentary legislations to improve performance.
• The transformation of the Parliament into a forum for discussing “Public Policy Alternatives" to achieve SDGs. It involves prioritizing discussions on policy alternatives and proposed solutions over specific legislative proposals.

• Designated number of parliamentary sessions should be dedicated to reviewing government performance within the framework of SDGs. This includes presenting working papers on developmental sectors before legislation is introduced. The aim is to provide background information and alternatives without obligating the government, allowing for practical discussions after the approval of appropriate policies, following evaluations of previous and current policies.
• Periodic data and information are made available for the purpose of continuously updating the informational basis of the legislative process, so that policy alternatives are realistic when presented. The parliament's effectiveness in fulfilling its role is hindered when elected representatives lack a proper understanding of reality due to an information gap between the government and parliament, hence undermining the accountability process by disconnecting it from actual circumstances.
• Conducting objective technical studies for certain issues related to the proposed legislation, which requires increasing the efficiency of the secretariats of committees in the Parliament by investing in training their staff, in partnership with the private sector and development partners, to provide the necessary technical support with the aim of increasing the capabilities of parliamentarians to analyze information and data.
• Priority in the legislative agenda for draft laws related to SDGs and the speed of issuance of implementing regulations for new legislations. It is crucial for this process to occur at a suitable pace, without compromising the thorough examination of the content, while aligning with the state's objective of addressing developmental challenges in specific sectors promptly. It is important to acknowledge that the issuance of regulations can be intricate at times.
• Conducting periodic evaluations of legislation impact and engage in societal dialogue on draft laws prior to their approval.
• Seek guidance from the “ERRADA” initiative, which focuses on reforming the legislative system regulating the business environment and building a database of legislations that regulate the business environment, in a way that enables the implementation of similar initiatives in other sectors, such as social and service fields (health, education and transportation...etc.).

# 6. Supportive Cultural Values System

## Definition:
Cultural values are principles that enable individuals to discern between right and wrong conduct. They significantly influence people's actions in various circumstances. Similarly, development values are a set of fundamental positive principles and convictions that are prevalent in society. These values foster a spirit of progress, necessitating effective socioeconomic transformations to enhance the overall quality of life and attain sustainable social, economic, and environmental well-being. There exists a reciprocal relationship between these values and development, as they are prerequisites for achieving development and ultimately yielding the fruits of progress.

## Significance:
Sustainable development requires supportive cultural values that stimulate behaviors that preserve the outcomes of development, establish respect for the law, spread respect for diversity, difference, and non-discrimination, and reject violent behaviors of all kinds. Supportive cultural values can make any boom in economic and human capital either capable of continuing, or subject to rapid decline and loss. To the extent that the Egyptian society enjoys positive values that define its personality and distinguish it from other people, it is also important to try to develop other values closely related to the development process. Among the most beneficial of these values are those associated with the importance of work (diligence, perfection, perseverance), participation (volunteering, cooperation, social responsibility), and transparency (honesty, truth, respect for the law, and the preservation of public funds).

# Current Landscape:
• Egypt has a large and influential youth demographic that is susceptible to instilling new values. According to the 2017 census data, around one-third of Egypt's population is under 15 years old (34.2%), and another third falls between 15 and 35 years old (34.5%). This demographic composition indicates a "youthful society” where more than half represents a value system that can be shaped at any given moment, providing an advantage not readily available in societies facing aging issues.
• A clear political will to develop the cultural system is evident in initiatives such as updating educational curricula and modernizing public discourse. Egypt has embarked on an ambitious program to develop and continuously update its educational curricula, coinciding with calls for renewing public discourse, especially religious discourse, to enhance positive values.
• Egypt has a broad and diverse cultural and media system, including various publishing houses with a long history, geographically distributed cultural centers and theaters, talented artists, and cinema and television channels. Additionally, there is a wealth of human potential that supports this system.

# Challenges:
Cultural values face several intellectual challenges stemming from the interaction with the effects of globalization and the declining role of societal institutions. Noteworthy challenges include:
• Cultural heritage tends to reinforce certain negative values such as narrow-mindedness, extremism, and discriminatory attitudes based on gender, age, and social class. Additionally, there is an excessive consumption pattern, a perpetuation of the past, and a prevalence of opportunistic and negative values, including a culture of deception, individualism, and a reluctance to accept differing opinions. Addressing this heritage is essential to mitigate its spread. Conversely, fostering a positive cultural heritage is crucial to instill values of tolerance, justice, rationality, prudence, frugality, ambition, excellence, openness to the world, generosity, and social responsibility. This necessitates distinguishing between these two types of heritage and working to revive positive

cultural heritage to drive development forward while minimizing the influence of negative cultural heritage in its various forms to safeguard and sustain developmental achievements.
• Potential resistance to change due to negative cultural heritage and entrenched customs, compounded by the prevalence of illiteracy. This phenomenon is observed across various age groups, necessitating careful consideration and intervention, despite the fact that the majority of the Egyptian population is under 40 years old.
• Spread of certain anti-modernization, anti-progress, and anti-development tendencies, along with resistance to innovation within some social segments, is evident, particularly in popular literature through expressions, sayings, stories, and proverbs that reinforce stagnation, despair, inertia, and insufficient belief in individuals' and society's self-capabilities.

# Objective:
The aim is to reinforce a set of positive values that amplify the influence of the country's development endeavors, while simultaneously addressing values that hinder progress.

# Key Enabling Policies:
• Promoting a culture of respecting the law and preserving public funds by incorporating this value into educational curricula and highlighting positive models in society.
• Stimulating values of loyalty and belonging by bringing youth-whether in schools or educational institutions- closer to the national institutions, introducing them to these institutions, and widely disseminating cultural content to acquaint individuals of various age groups with Egypt's history.
• Preserving the Egyptian identity for the children of Egyptians residing abroad and promoting values of coexistence, acceptance of others, and tolerance.
• Enhancing social capital by strengthening values of cooperation and trust among individuals. Social capital is indispensable for progress, strongly linked to achieving developmental breakthroughs in

any society. The values of social trust and cooperation contribute to a deeper connection among members of society, the establishment of strong institutions (whether governmental, civil, or private), the promotion of participation, and the reduction of transaction costs (thereby achieving higher economic efficiency).
• Promoting social trust and cooperation to create a robust civil society capable of integrating a large number of citizens into its activities. This enables them to explore broader opportunities for interaction and voluntary work beyond the confines of official institutions.
• Promoting volunteer work to achieve inclusive development, as it can only be achieved through the coordination of state efforts and their integration with the entire society. Emphasizing volunteer work values, raising awareness among youth, and integrating them into curricula and student activities at all educational levels is essential.
• Effective coordination and integration between the GoE and the civil society play a significant role in clarifying societal needs and local variations. This collaboration contributes to implementing state development initiatives on the ground, fostering a dynamic national civil society that partners in the development process. It can express various public opinions, social priorities, and urgent social demands.
• Upholding a culture that values scientific knowledge and facts is crucial for promoting rationality in public discourse, policy alternatives, and enhancing the scientific approach in public discussions and dialogues. This starts with the commitment of official state institutions to these values in their rhetoric and behavior. Additionally, confronting alternative narratives that promote myths and rumors.
• Addressing intellectual bias and extremism involves deepening tolerance and acceptance of others. Development in any society is unattainable without increased openness to the world, people, and cultures, whether in economic transactions, knowledge exchange, or collaboration in solving common problems. A society aspiring for development must embody tolerance and acceptance of others, regardless of their differences. It is equally important to promote values of

religious and racial tolerance, acceptance of others, and openness to different cultures through educational channels, awareness tools, and official public discourse.

# 7. Population Growth Control
## Definition:
Population growth control aims to align population growth rates with the natural resources and economic growth of the state while considering its fiscal space. This is crucial to prevent negative impacts on the average per capita share of natural resources (especially water, energy, and agricultural land) and government expenditure.

## Significance:
Egypt has been facing population growth issue for several decades. If left unaddressed, continuous population increase can undermine any additional progress achieved in development. The persistent population growth contributes to social instability due to resource competition, creating a sense of relative deprivation despite increased development rates. This situation hinders the expected benefits, even with higher economic growth rates and investments in infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, roads, and transportation.

## Current Landscape:
According to the 2021 Egyptian Family Health Survey:
• The rate of usage of family planning methods increased, reaching around 66.4% in 2021 compared to approximately 58.5% in 2014.
• The unmet need for family planning methods is increasing reaching about 41%, presenting an opportunity for efforts to control population growth, especially as there is a significant number of

44

women who want to use family planning methods but face obstacles such as unavailability or high cost.
• The total fertility rate decreased by about 0.8 child compared to the level recorded in 2014, reaching 2.7 children per woman in 2022 .[10]
• The GoE has initiated the implementation of the Executive Plan for the National Project for the Development of the Egyptian Family (2021/2022 – 2023/2024), focusing on two main aspects: controlling population growth and enhancing population characteristics in education, health, job opportunities, economic empowerment, and culture. The plan revolves around five pillars: Women's Economic Empowerment; Availability of Family Planning Methods; Cultural, Media, and Educational Interventions to raise awareness about the population issue; Utilizing Digital Transformation to reach the targeted population; and Legislative Interventions to establish a comprehensive framework for population-related policies.

# Challenges:
• The persistence of the high fertility rate threatens that Egypt's population will reach 130 million in 2030, which places enormous pressure on the state's resources, mainly the per capita share of water.
• Cultural factors, influenced by popular heritage promoting traditional values, play a role in the preference for larger families and the prioritization of males over females. Additionally, religious discourse supporting higher fertility rates poses obstacles to development goals in both the short and long terms.
• An increase in the percentage of the age group that is less than one year to 9 years, followed by the age of marriage and childbearing during the period from 2030 to 2042, which may result in a boom in births starting from 2030 if the population problem is not dealt with seriously and proactively.

# Objective:
To reduce population growth rates, in order to create a balance between economic growth rates and population growth rates. This contributes significantly to increasing the per capita share of public spending, especially in education and health. Consequently, enhance the ability to improve population characteristics and achieve a significant increase in individuals' income levels.

# Key Enabling Policies:
* Increasing the usage rates of family planning methods by targeting women of childbearing age. This involves providing these services free of charge in all health institutions and establishing mobile clinics to cover remote areas.
* Allocating a provision in the state's general budget to ensure the continuous and long-term availability of family planning methods, guaranteeing their free provision. This should also cover the training of medical teams, the cost of mobile clinics, and community awareness programs.
* Increasing knowledge and awareness of the small family model through community mobilization that relies on prominent figures of fame and status who have the people's trust, with the ability to influence public opinion. Additionally, encourage local leaders and religious figures to adopt family planning issues in their speeches, along with the continuous development of media messages based on scientific studies, opinion polls, and innovative content that deepens their impact on behavior.
* Incorporating population issues into school curricula to instill the importance of family planning in young minds.
* Effectively implementing laws setting the minimum age of marriage and considering a harsher punishment for underage marriage.
* Expanding the pre-marital screenings and counseling programs.

# Introduction:
The strategic goal of “Improve Egyptians' Quality of Life and Raise their Living Standards”, positioned at the forefront of the strategic goals of Egypt's Vision 2030, aims to provide the basic requirements of life for every Egyptian.

Egypt's Vision 2030 interprets the concept of “Poverty Eradication” beyond merely reducing material poverty. It encompasses a multidimensional approach by creating the basic conditions for all segments of society to lead a dignified life in their homeland. The vision recognizes that comprehensive development should not only focus on reducing poverty rates but also extend to providing the citizens' needs of education, healthcare, housing, food, and decent work, along with other vital aspects like cultural and sports activities. It's essential to note that these components are interconnected, influencing each other significantly.

Egypt has witnessed slow progress in its quality of life ranking, standing at 97th among 191 countries in the Human Development Index issued by the UNDP in the 2021 report. This index relies on crucial aspects of quality of life, primarily health, education, food, and poverty.

In the poverty domain, for instance, nearly one-third of the population still falls below the national poverty line. Regarding education, approximately 17.5% of the population lacks literacy skills [11]. Additionally, around 13.2 million people reside in informal settlements as of 2021. [12] Moreover, about 5.5 million citizens faced food shortages in 2020. [13]

In response to these challenges, the GoE adopted an integrated development approach through collaboration among national institutions, civil society, and the private sector. This collaborative effort aims to unify and coordinate actions to provide essential services for most vulnerable social groups, ultimately raising their living standards in all aspects of life by adopting huge initiatives, such as the presidential initiative “Hayah Karima” (Decent Life Initiative).

Within this framework, the strategic goal aligns with the global SDGs; namely SDG 1: “No Poverty”; SDG 2: "Zero Hunger”; SDG 3: “Good Health and Well Being”; SDG 4: "Quality Education”; SDG 8: “Decent Work and Economic Growth”; and SDG 11: “Sustainable Cities and Communities”. Additionally, it resonates with the Africa Agenda 2063, aligning with the first, second, third, fourth and fifth goals of the first aspiration "A prosperous Africa based on inclusive growth and sustainable development”, the tenth goal of the second aspiration “An integrated continent, politically united and based on the ideals of Pan-Africanism and the vision of Africa's Renaissance”, in addition to the sixteenth goal of the fifth aspiration “An Africa with a strong cultural identity, common heritage, shared values and ethics".

Furthermore, this strategic goal reflects the set of social rights guaranteed by the Egyptian constitution for all citizens, mainly “every citizen has the right to education with the aim of building the Egyptian character, planting the roots of scientific thinking, developing talents, and promoting innovation" and “every citizen is entitled to health and to comprehensive health care with quality criteria".

This goal, with its various determinants, aligns with the Guiding Principles that form the framework of Egypt's Vision 2030. Anchored in the principle of “Human-Centered Development”, the GoE commits to improving lives of the Egyptian citizens through the application of the principles of "Equity and Accessibility” to achieve sustainable development characterized by “Resilience and Adaptation" to international and local exigencies. It also upholds environmental preservation and ensures "Sustainability”.

The set of enablers also facilitate the achievement of the general goals of this strategic goal. The availability of "financing” to provide services and the existence of more advanced and efficient solutions to challenges in various dimensions through “technology and innovation”, “digital transformation,” and “data generation and availability,” in light of a “supportive legislative and

institutional environment” along with the presence of “supportive cultural values” allow the formation of highly efficient programs to achieve the desired goals. This, in turn, is related to "controlling population growth” and limiting the steady increase in the size of the population because of the pressure it generates on the demand for basic services, and its clear challenge to any efforts to improve the quality of life.

The strategic goal of “Improve Egyptians' Quality of Life and Raise their Living Standards” is achieved through six general goals: Poverty Eradication; Food Provision; Access to Distinct Health Services; Quality Education System; Access to Adequate Housing; and Enriched Cultural and Sports Life.

# 1. Poverty Eradication

No developmental process succeeds unless it addresses the eradication of poverty, not only financial or material poverty but also multidimensional poverty. Egypt's Vision 2030 emphasizes that eliminating multidimensional poverty is a pivotal goal, aiming to provide the minimum essential needs for individuals and families, including food, housing, clothing, education, health, and transportation. This is to enable them to lead a dignified life in their homeland.

## Current Landscape:

Despite the development efforts that reduced poverty rates in Egypt for the first time in two decades, as it decreased from 32.5% in 2017/18 to 29.7% in 2019/20,[14] thanks to improved economic growth on the one hand and the direct support provided to families through social protection programs, national projects that provided new job opportunities, and economic reform policies, on the other. However, there is still a need for effective policies and plans to eradicate poverty and address its various dimensions and negative consequences, in addition to reducing the disparities between

different regions and rural and urban areas. Although poverty has significantly declined in Upper Egypt's governorates since 2018, they remain among the poorest regions. Additionally, rural poverty has increased and now accounts for two-thirds of the poverty rate in both Upper and Lower Egypt.

As for the extreme poverty rate; indicating the percentage of citizens unable to meet their basic humanitarian needs, it decreased to 4.5% during the fiscal year 2019/20 compared to 6.2% in 2017/18.[15]

Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to elevate the average income of families to meet their needs, reduce multidimensional poverty, and provide a dignified and civilized standard of living for all Egyptians. This will be achieved within a framework of geographical justice through an inclusive developmental system, focusing on investing in human capital while adopting social inclusion to ensure the success of sustainable development.

## Means for goal attainment:
*   Control Population Growth through regulating increasing population growth is essential, as poverty is often linked to larger-sized families, which burdens the capacity to provide basic needs.
*   Establish an integrated protection system for those below the poverty line.
*   Expand exceptional social protection programs to include those living below the poverty line and the most in need groups, even in challenging circumstances.
*   Introducing additional social protection programs to combat poverty, and offer conditional cash assistance.
*   Promoting private sector investments to foster the creation of more decent employment opportunities.

# 2. Food Provision
Efforts to eradicate poverty and provide an advanced educational system, inclusive healthcare, and decent housing for all Egyptians are fundamental. However, these objectives cannot fully enhance human lives if citizens do not receive sufficient, healthy, and safe nutrition from an early age. Egypt's Vision 2030 recognizes the importance of providing adequate and healthy food for all Egyptians in reducing susceptibility to communicable and non-communicable diseases, in addition to the significance of ensuring that all Egyptians enjoy good physical health enabling them to enjoy life, work, and be productive. Accordingly, Egypt's Vision 2030 has designated “Food Provision” for all Egyptians as a crucial goal, considering it one of the pillars of quality of life.

## Current Landscape:
Numerous factors, mainly population growth, inadequate healthcare services, and sufficient social protection system, have led to a decrease in food levels among Egyptians, posing a threat to food security, particularly for lower-income individuals. Approximately, 5.4% of the population still suffer from malnutrition, while 27.8% experienced moderate to severe food insecurity in 2019. [16]

The shortage of food brings forth a host of problems, such as deteriorating health conditions, weakness, emaciation, and decreased productivity. Access to healthy food is a fundamental human right that should be guaranteed to all, especially children. Malnutrition in children often leads to various associated illnesses that hinder their proper growth, including anemia, obesity, and conditions affecting proper growth, like stunting and chronic diseases.

# 3. Access to Distinct Health Services
Enhancing the quality of life lies in ensuring the well-being of citizens and offering them adequate care for both communicable and non-communicable diseases [17] all the while minimizing the burdens imposed upon them. To enable every individual to embrace a wholesome lifestyle, Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to elevate the healthcare sector, improve citizens' health status, foster preventive measures, facilitate treatment, and proactively combat the propagation of diseases and pandemics.

Various dimensions come into play to attain this goal, necessitating the collaboration of multiple stakeholders - along with the Ministry of Health and Population's role in delivering appropriate healthcare services - to address health concerns. This is done through an approach encompassing

economic, social, and cultural policies, which directly and indirectly impact the challenges and opportunities encountered within the healthcare sector, ultimately driving the desired development.

# Current Landscape

With the steady rise in Egypt's population over the past decades, the disease landscape has transformed. Both communicable and non-communicable diseases have started to proliferate, leading to increased healthcare costs for citizens. This is coupled with a decline in the number of doctors, nursing staff, and hospital beds per thousand people at the governorate level. There has been a significant drop in healthcare quality, exacerbated by insufficient funding for the government health sector, resulting in a rise in private expenditure on healthcare. According to the WHO standards, Egypt was ranked 63rd out of 191 countries in terms of its healthcare system in 2020.

According to the WHO in 2019, Egypt stood out among the nations with the highest out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure as a percentage of current health expenditure, with 26.3% of the population spending over 10% of their income on health. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical need to enhance the capacity to handle outbreaks and unexpected health crises. It has emphasized the importance of establishing a robust healthcare system capable of managing such crises.

Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to provide healthcare for citizens, promoting their well-being and nutrition starting from an early age to maintain their health, identify any chronic illnesses at an early stage, and provide appropriate treatment. This requires an increase in efficient healthcare spending across all areas of the sector, as well as ensuring accessible healthcare for everyone. This is besides bolstering the preparedness of the healthcare system to mitigate disease prevalence and combat pandemics and communicable diseases by enhancing the capabilities of medical research centers nationwide.

# 4.Quality Education System

Education stands at the forefront of Egypt's Vision 2030; recognizing its vital role in elevating people's standard of living and developing quality of life. Therefore, the Vision prioritizes efforts to achieve a notable progress in education, aiming to produce highly competent professionals capable of serving the nation, each in their respective areas of specialization.

The significance of early childhood and pre-university education is no less important than that of university education. Educating children and nurturing their skills at a young age shape their future capacity to learn, innovate, and uphold civilized and cultural values. Meanwhile, university education complements this foundation by ingraining the scientific approach to thinking and fostering the acquisition of knowledge and technical competencies necessary for individuals to enter the labor market. It acts as a bridge between traditional education and the fast-paced technological advancements of our contemporary world.

## Current Landscape:

The rapid population growth and the stagnation of the education system, which has lacked development for several decades, led to a decline in the quality of education in Egypt. This has resulted in an outdated educational system that emphasizes indoctrination, rote memorization, and a lack of stimulating critical thinking and analytical skills among students. As a result, the country has experienced high rates of illiteracy and a low educational ranking. Furthermore, the university admission system has created an imbalance within the education system and the labor market, further exacerbating the gap between education and the labor market.

According to data from CAPMAS, illiteracy rate in Egypt is 17.5% in 2022, compared to 25.8% in 2017. These rates were notably higher among females reaching 22.8% compared to12.4% in males. Likewise, in rural areas, illiteracy is more prevalent than in urban areas, with rates of 21.8% and 12.1%, respectively, according to the 2022 Labor Force Survey. Moreover, Egypt falls below the world

average in quality education indicators, according to the World Bank standards, with an average literacy rate of 73.1% in 2021, compared to the global average of 86.8% in 2020.

However, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the GoE launched several e-learning platforms to ensure the continuity of remote learning. Approximately 10.5 million electronic exams were conducted, allowing access to 20 million students on the educational platforms provided by the Ministry of Education and Technical Education.

“Education 2.0” system, introduced in 2018, has accelerated the adoption of such reformative measures. Additionally, a hybrid education system has been implemented in universities, combining remote learning and its technologies with traditional in-person learning in educational institutions. This approach aims to ensure the readiness of the education system for any crises. Moreover, the Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB) has also been launched, serving as a comprehensive repository of knowledge accessible to all Egyptians.

Believing in the importance of transforming the Egyptian society into a learning, thinking, and innovative community to equip a cadre of scientists capable of solving Egypt's and the world's challenges, Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to enhance the quality of education and expand access to quality education for everyone, with no discrimination. It emphasizes fostering creativity and innovation by integrating technology as a fundamental component of education. This ultimately leads to the development of Egypt's human capital; with a special focus on children and youth, empowering them to excel in various fields of the labor market.

## Means for Goal Attainment:
* Increasing investment in education and linking all aspects of expenditure to the quality of educational outcomes.

# 5. Access to Adequate Housing
The provision of adequate housing and creating sustainable cities is a crucial aspect of development in every country. The quality of housing directly impacts the quality of life. In fact, decent housing in civilized areas that are free from health hazards and an environment characterized by clean air, water, and sanitation, influences every aspect of a citizen's life. Egypt's Vision 2030 addresses the housing issue at both individual and societal levels. At the individual level, the Vision strives to guarantee access to adequate housing for all Egyptians at affordable prices that cater to all groups. At the societal level, the Vision aims to develop cities characterized by modern infrastructure and abundant green spaces.

63

The GoE has initiated housing projects in new cities to increase the individual's share of green spaces, eliminate building on agricultural land, which persisted over previous decades, and explore opportunities for expansion and better utilization of Egypt's land.

## Current Landscape:
For decades, Egypt has relied on a limited land area, not exceeding 8% of its total area. With the absence of strict enforcement of building regulations and penalties for violations, coupled with continuous population growth and high migration rates from rural to urban areas, the capacity of this limited space has been incapable of accommodating the surging population. Consequently, unplanned residential areas and unsafe housing have become prevalent. Therefore, the state adopted various policies to address this phenomenon. The results have been positive, with a reduction in the percentage of people living in informal (unsafe and unplanned) urban areas to 36% by 2019.[18] Nonetheless, this matter continues to pose a challenge for the state and a primary goal to ensure a civilized life for all citizens.

Within this framework, Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to provide decent and civilized housing for all Egyptians without exception. Additionally, the Vision seeks to eradicate the phenomenon of unsafe and informal housing, while offering legitimate alternatives that align with the development agenda. Likewise, it seeks to enhance the quality of basic services in all residential areas and increase the availability of open spaces and green areas for individuals.

## Means for Goal Attainment:
* Expansion of New Cities in Governorates to alleviate pressure on housing and public facilities.

* Provide incentive packages for the private sector to expand new urban clusters to generate employment opportunities and services in these areas.
* Development and enhancement of Egyptian villages and centers in Rural Areas.
* Vacating unsafe housing classified as informal settlements and transforming dilapidated buildings into habitable structures.
* Developing existing housing that lacks basic services, providing sanitation services, and ensuring access to clean water.
* Increase open and green spaces in residential areas.
* Enacting legislation to support building laws, address building violations, and compensate vacated areas.
* Halt urban expansion and encroachments on agricultural lands and prevent encroachments on the Nile River.

# 6. Enriched Cultural and Sports Life
Developing the cultural and sports life is a pivotal element in the goal of improving Egyptians' quality of life and raising their living standards. Recognizing the intrinsic value of culture and sports, and their essential role in shaping the Egyptians' identity throughout history, Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to preserve and enrich Egyptian culture and sports, while raising awareness among Egyptians about their significance in achieving a decent life.

Culture is a lifestyle encompassing the set of values, ethics, ideas, knowledge, habits, traditions, beliefs, worldviews, customs, arts, and various forms of individual creativity, both material and

immaterial, as well as everything an individual acquires as a member of society. On the other hand, sports involve physical effort and skills practiced for entertainment, competition, excellence, health improvement, and bodily strength. Sports contribute to individual development, fostering mental, physical, and social adaptation.

Undoubtedly, Egypt's wealth lies in its tangible and intangible cultural heritage, as well as its soft power derived from its abundance of intellectuals, writers, scientists, thinkers, authors, artists, and creators in fields such as music, visual arts, cinema, and theater. To uplift the Egyptian people, it is imperative to harness this rich cultural capital in nurturing an Egyptian citizen firmly rooted in their cultural identity, cognizant of their history and cultural heritage, capable of confronting contemporary challenges, ensuring access to avenues of knowledge acquisition, respecting diversity, fostering the ability to make free choices, as well as engaging in cultural practices and production. Positive elements within culture serve as a source of strength for development, an added value to the national economy, and the foundation of Egypt's soft power on regional and global scales.

## Current Landscape:
With the population growth over the past decades, accompanied by a rise in poverty rates, citizens' interest in cultural centers and sports facilities has declined. Simultaneously, the ability of cultural institutions in various governorates and sports centers to meet the cultural and sporting needs of individuals has been reduced. This has resulted in a clear gap in the establishment and accessibility of these institutions across different geographical areas and social segments.

Consequently, a lack of cultural awareness has emerged, leading to various problems related to thinking, education, and knowledge. Limited interest in reading, the absence of students' ability for critical thinking and analysis, and a decline in the desire of the youth to educate themselves have all been observed as consequences of this cultural gap. On the sporting front, there has been a decline

in championships across various team and individual sports, accompanied by a deterioration in physical and mental health levels, evidenced by the prevalence of obesity and non-communicable diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and depression. Additionally, there has been a rise in drug use among the youth.

Therefore, Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to support and enrich cultural life in all its forms, enhance citizens' awareness of sports, and provide inclusive sports facilities without discrimination based on financial capability or geographical location.

## Means for Goal Attainment:
* Increase the percentage of funds allocated to culture and sports within the total state budget.
* Develop governmental cultural institutions by enhancing administrative capacities and human resources, equipping them for cultural and artistic work. This will allow them to broaden their reach to various social segments while preserving identity and foster openness to other cultures.
* Enhance the role of non-governmental cultural institutions through community partnerships involving the government, civil society, and the private sector.
* Expand cultural facilities, cultural palaces and centers, public libraries, museums, heritage sites, opera houses, art galleries, theaters, and cinemas in various governorates and new cities, ensuring accessibility for all residents.
* Encouraging the preservation, protection, and accessibility of tangible and intangible cultural heritage, and harnessing its potential for sustainable development, creativity, and the promotion of cultural identity.
* Instill awareness of the importance of culture and sports, as well as heritage preservation among youth by emphasizing them in education curricula.
* Establish an integrated information system for cultural work, enabling accurate data-driven

* Adopt unconventional tools to raise cultural awareness using information technology for all age groups and communities.
* Support the digital transformation of cultural processes to ensure broad accessibility of cultural products, enhance public taste, and promote positive values.
* Provide an enabling environment for implementing innovative ideas, making cultural products available in remote and underserved areas, achieving cultural equity, and combating intellectual extremism.
* Encourage domestic tourism as a means to enrich cultural life, instilling citizens' pride in their identity and unity within the context of cultural diversity, and leveraging Egypt's diverse environment for various sporting activities.
* Combat all forms of bias and intellectual extremism by promoting a culture of moderation, broad-mindedness, respect for differences, and embracing change, while actively countering extremism and intolerance that perpetuate violence and terrorism.
* Rehabilitate all forms of cultural and sports facilities to accommodate the needs of individuals with disabilities across all governorates.
* Ensuring availability of sports facilities, such as centers, arenas, sports cities, and stadiums in proportion to the population in different geographical regions.

# Introduction:

The achievement of sustainable development in any society is intricately tied to the successful realization of the strategic goal of "Social Justice and Equality". Social justice is the equitable distribution of income, enabling citizens to meet their basic needs and progress economically and socially. This distribution must ensure equal opportunities for all, free from discrimination based on age, gender, disability, religion, or geographical location.

This principle of equality ensures that all public resources, benefits, and services, including education, healthcare, and infrastructure, are accessible to every citizen. It also encompasses the enjoyment of fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression and the right to work, and civil rights like private property, without any form of discrimination.

The strategic goal of “Social Justice and Equality” within Egypt's Vision 2030 aims at fostering active citizenship and meaningful participation across political, economic, cultural, and social aspects for all societal segments, especially the most vulnerable groups who require positive discrimination in their favor. This aligns with Egypt's Vision for sustainable development and resonates with key issues emphasized by the SDGs, namely SDG 5 “Gender Equality" and SDG10 “Reduced Inequalities”.

Moreover, this goal is closely tied to the aspirations of Africa's Agenda 2063, specifically within the first goal of the first aspiration “A prosperous Africa, based on inclusive growth and sustainable development”, and the eleventh goal of the third aspiration "An Africa of Good Governance, Democracy, Respect for Human Rights, Justice and the Rule of Law” and the seventeenth, and the eighteenth of the sixth aspiration "An Africa whose development is people driven, relying on the potential offered by African People, especially its women and youth, and caring for children”.

At the national level, the Egyptian constitution emphasizes that “the state commits to providing the means to achieve social solidarity and equal opportunity without discrimination to ensure decent life for all citizens”, in addition to “achieving equality between women and men in all civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights".

Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to bridge developmental gaps, particularly in rural areas and specifically Upper Egypt. These regions face high poverty rates and low levels of employment, income, and access to basic services, such as education, healthcare, culture, and sports, in comparison to urban areas. These disparities are evident in women's struggle to secure job opportunities, high rates of female illiteracy, and limited access to certain social services compared to males.

With regards to children, a significant percentage continues to experience various dimensions of poverty, stemming from factors such as large family sizes or early marriages, leading to an inability to meet the basic needs of the child. This results in health issues associated with malnutrition, such as stunting and obesity.

For youth, mismatched educational outputs with labor market needs lead to higher unemployment rates. Similarly, individuals with disabilities encounter numerous challenges in the field of education, such as the prevalence of illiteracy due to the lack of suitable schools catering to their specific needs. Moreover, they face difficulties in finding appropriate employment opportunities, considering the lack of jobs that accommodate their diverse disabilities. Additionally, they face difficulties accessing transportation services equipped to meet their needs and services tailored to their requirements.

Lastly, the elderly face obstacles in accessing their rights, including public services, healthcare, and psychological support, compounded by technological barriers arising from the digitization of transactions and services.

It is evident that the integration of the national Vision for sustainable development, which Egypt committed to achieve, with implemented policies and reforms, is the key to bridging developmental gaps across diverse geographic regions and reducing disparities among social groups, particularly for the most vulnerable categories: women, children, youth, individuals with disabilities, and the elderly.

74

The achievement of this goal aligns with the fundamental guiding principles of Egypt's Vision 2030, emphasizing the placement of “Human-Centered Development” at the core of all endeavors to elevate the living standards for all Egyptians in various geographic regions. This involves applying the principle of “Equity and Accessibility”, ensuring equal opportunities for everyone in rights and public services. Additionally, the principle of "Resilience and Adaptation" facilitates people's ability to adapt through social protection programs. Moreover, the principle of “Sustainability” further underscores the importance of natural resource access for all societal segments while preserving the needs of future generations.

Several enablers contribute to the realization of this strategic goal, namely “Financing” that supports providing the necessary financial resources to empower vulnerable groups economically; "Digital Transformation” that facilitate citizens' access to basic services and improve the subsidies system, particularly targeting and strengthening communication channels between all societal segments; a "Supportive Legislative and Institutional Environment” aids in activating laws and strategies to enhance active participation for all segments and uphold their rights; in addition to the "Supportive Cultural Values System” that also contributes to spreading awareness of values, promoting tolerance, acceptance, respect, and rejection of bullying, discrimination, and arrogance. This system also corrects misconceptions related to women and early marriage, particularly in rural areas and villages; lastly, “Population Growth Control” helps maximize the benefits of development.

The strategic goal of "Social Justice and Equality” is achieved through four general goals: Social Protection Provision; Gender Gap Reduction; Inclusion and Equal Opportunities; and Promotion of Spatial and Local Development. Each general goal encompasses a set of targets, enabling policies to achieve them, along with quantitative indicators for monitoring and evaluating performance.

# 1. Social Protection Provision

Social Protection Provision encompasses a set of policies supporting men, women, and children in achieving and maintaining a decent standard of living and good health throughout their lives. These policies consist of three elements:

A. Social and health insurance that mitigates risks associated with unemployment, health issues, disabilities, work-related injuries, and aging, such as health insurance or insurance against unemployment.

B. Social safety nets that provide cash or in-kind support to individuals or families living in poverty.

C. Labor market interventions that aim at implementing programs to enhance effective employment in labor markets and protect workers.

The pursuit of justice is closely tied to the existence of an interconnected network of social protection programs, which cater to the most vulnerable groups experiencing poverty due to various circumstances. Such programs not only elevate the economic well-being of impoverished families but also shield other groups from sudden shocks and fluctuations. Therefore, social protection programs play a crucial role in reducing inequality, promoting social cohesion, and fostering peace, particularly in the short run and in times of unexpected crises.

## Current Landscape

In light of the current status of social protection programs, the total expenditure on subsidies, grants, and social benefits reached EGP 343 billion in 2021/22, constituting 19% of the total expenditure, reflecting the growing interest in increasing the financing for these programs. In recent years, the GoE has reviewed health and social insurance systems to overcome deficiencies in both systems and broaden the protection coverage to include more categories.

76

***

In the field of health insurance, the Universal Health Insurance Law was issued in 2018, as a social solidarity system providing healthcare services to everyone without discrimination. The Government covers those unable to pay. Subsequently, in 2019, the Social Insurance and Pensions Law was enacted with new features such as setting a minimum pension, adjusting the relationship between the pension amount and inflation rates, entitlement to unemployment benefits, encouraging incentives for insuring irregular workers, and the gradual increase in retirement age, and more. Furthermore, the state issued “Aman” certificates for irregular workers to provide temporary social protection for them and their families in the event of disability or death, serving as an interim solution until a comprehensive regulatory law is enacted.

The GoE has also taken several measures to enhance and improve social safety nets, including the food support system, targeted cash support, social housing, school nutrition programs, and more. However, the main challenges include insufficient financial resources to cover social safety nets amid an increase in poverty rates, limited human and logistical capacities of institutions overseeing social protection, and the failure to link cash support to inflation rates, resulting in a gradual decrease in the real value of assistance.

Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to expand the scope and coverage of social protection networks, enhance the benefits received by individuals, and improve the targeting mechanisms and institutional arrangements to maximize their effectiveness.

# 2. Gender Gap Reduction

Achieving social justice is closely interlinked with the genuine pursuit of gender equality, supporting equal opportunities, and enhancing women's participation in the development process leading to empowering women economically, socially, and politically. This encompasses the eradication of all forms of discrimination and violence against women in addition to bolstering women's right to education, access to healthcare services, employment, and political participation.

## Current Landscape:

Studies examining status of women reveal a gap in women's participation compared to men in various aspects of life, particularly economically. This is evident in the low rate of women's participation in the labor force, which reached 13.5% in 2020/21. Along with the significantly higher unemployment rate among women, reaching 15.2% compared to 5.8% among men. [19] Despite the advancements achieved for women through the implementation of the National Strategy for the Empowerment of Egyptian Women 2030, especially in education, healthcare, life expectancy rates, and political empowerment, the economic gender gap remains unaltered, as per most indicators measuring gender inequality.

The Gender Gap Index published by the World Economic Forum in 2021 positioned Egypt at 129th out of 156 countries, compared to its previous rank 134th out of 153 countries in 2020. Moreover, Egypt's ranking in the Economic Participation and Opportunity Index in 2021 was 146, compared to 140 in 2020. The decline in women's participation in the labor market, especially in the private sector, is attributed to various factors, including social norms and values, inadequate childcare facilities, mismatched transportation, violence against women, and a misalignment between educational outcomes and the needs of the labor market.

Regarding education, despite achieving some progress, females still suffer from higher illiteracy rates compared to males, especially in rural areas of Upper Egypt. The illiteracy rate among females exceeds 30.8% for those above ten years old, compared to 21.1% for males in 2017. [20]

As for healthcare, the main challenges include the lack of some healthcare services in rural areas, in addition to issues such as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and the impact of early marriage on women's physical and mental health. Regarding FGM, although the percentage has decreased from 21% in the age group (0-19 years) in 2014 to 14% in 2021, according to the Egyptian Family Health Survey, it remains a cultural challenge. The 2017 Egypt Census results indicated that 0.6% of female marriages involve individuals below the legal age, with 61.5% of these marriages occurring in rural areas, and the percentage increases in the poorest governorates. [21]

Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to narrow the gender gap by empowering women to actively participate in all social, cultural, economic, and political aspects. The Vision emphasizes women's involvement in the workforce, enhanced political empowerment, reduction of female illiteracy rates, and provision of healthcare specifically for women in rural areas.

## Means for Goal Attainment:
* Raise awareness of the risks of gender-based discrimination against women, change prevailing negative cultural norms and perceptions regarding frequent childbearing, early marriage, and limited access to education for girls in various regions of Egypt.
* Facilitate women's access to job opportunities, enhance mechanisms for home-based work and flexible working hours, and develop codes of conduct in collaboration with the private sector to

# 3. Inclusion and Equal Opportunities
In the pursuit of justice and social security, Inclusion and Equal Opportunities emerge as essential prerequisites. This entails ensuring fairness and non-discrimination in providing opportunities for all citizens across various domains. The sole criteria for social and economic mobility should be merit and entitlement. Consequently, a societal transformation is needed to enhance greater inclusion and activate a larger role for more social, economic, and political participation, especially for vulnerable groups, including women, children, youth, persons with disabilities, and the elderly. Equal opportunities encompass granting these groups their rights to a dignified life, health, education, and employment without discrimination.

## Current Landscape:
Despite recent progress in certain indicators over the past two decades, such as the reduction in child mortality and improved access to basic education, and reducing gender gap in education enrollment, some indicators still point to challenges in fulfilling children's rights. For instance, the low enrollment rate in pre-primary education, reaching approximately 28.5% in 2019/20, implying that more than two-thirds of children aged 4-5 years do not enjoy their right to early education. [22]

As for youth, this group faces high unemployment rates, with an unemployment rate of 15% for the age group 15-29 years, compared to the national rate of 7.4% in 2021.[23] This is attributed to the mismatch between the outputs of the education system and the requirements of the job market, coupled with the reduction in government and public sector jobs since the mid-1980s.

Finally, persons with disabilities face challenges due to the lack of adequate schools, leading to a prevalence of illiteracy among them. In terms of employment, the majority experience forced

unemployment, lacking appropriate job opportunities. Additionally, their salaries and wages are lower compared to their able-bodied counterparts. Moreover, the infrastructure and public facilities, such as roads and transportation, do not adequately accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities, hindering their right to mobility and movement.

Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to address these disparities and empower all segments of society— economically, politically, and socially. The objective is to reduce the illiteracy rates for both females and males, decrease youth unemployment, protect children, and ensure their rights to proper nutrition, education, and healthcare. Furthermore, the vision seeks to integrate persons with disabilities into society and provide necessary care services for the elderly.

## Means for Goal Attainment:
• Ensuring equitable geographic distribution of schools based on the number of school-age children and providing nutritious meals for students.
• Enhance children's nutrition and health by developing mechanisms for early detection of nutrition-related diseases such as stunting and obesity, and raising awareness among their parents about proper nutrition methods.
• Protecting homeless children, providing rehabilitation programs, and collaborating with the civil society to support orphaned groups lacking care.
• Support the rights of children and adolescents and considering their best interests in all decision-making processes.
• Facilitate the access of people with disabilities to public places and facilities, and adapt services to facilitate their movement using transportation in urban and rural areas to cater to their specific needs.

• Facilitate the issuance of smart cards for integrated services for people with disabilities, and ensure their access to banking services.
• Provide all rehabilitation, training, educational, and health services for people with disabilities easily.
• Educating families about early detection methods of disabilities, providing psychological, social, cultural, and physical rehabilitation for disabled children to integrate them into society, and educational and cultural systems, as well as offering suitable job opportunities that align with their physical or cognitive abilities.
• Deepen political participation mechanisms for youth and all social groups and encourage youth to engage in collective and volunteer work to serve the community.
• Increase the availability of services for age-related diseases and services provided to the elderly, in addition to improving health and preventive medical services for them.

# 4. Promotion of Spatial and Local Development
The pursuit of spatial and local development is a pillar of social justice that the state aims to achieve by bridging the gaps in geographical development, particularly in rural and border areas. This involves targeting low-income groups, empowering communities both economically and socially, and preparing the local environment for development based on productivity and sustainability standards, to minimize the disparities between different regions. Spatial and local development ensures making available and improving basic services in all regions and governorates, especially in healthcare, education, and employment opportunities, and increased investment opportunities in the most in need regions.

84

## Current Landscape:
Disparity and inequality in Egypt are closely tied to specific geographic regions, particularly in rural areas, specifically the countryside of Upper Egypt. While the overall poverty rate in Egypt stood at approximately 29.7% in 2019/20, it significantly rises to 48.2% in the countryside of Upper Egypt.[24] It is important to note that the fundamental areas that necessitate radical attention in these geographic regions are linked to three key rights: the right to education, the right to healthcare, and the right to employment; in addition to the disparities in per capita public investment among different governorates. Thus, addressing the shortcomings related to social service coverage and the distribution of public investments will boost the ability of societal groups in these areas to enjoy other closely related rights, such as equal participation, regardless of the governorate.

Moreover, there is a clear disparity between rural and urban areas in terms of access to educational and healthcare services, income levels, wealth, employment rates, and gender equality indicators. Development in Upper Egypt is considered the most challenging among Egypt's geographic areas in terms of opportunities inequality, and limited available investment projects, which impacts the creation of high-yield jobs. This is manifested in the stark difference in the annual household income between rural and urban areas, reaching EGP 59.7 thousand in rural areas compared to EGP 80.9 thousand in urban areas in 2019/20.[25]

Additionally, rural areas suffer from a shortage of qualified human resources due to the weakness of educational institutions and the decreased efficiency of institutions providing basic services, especially in education and health. There is inequality in the quality of life in rural areas, particularly concerning the ease of access to various services.

# Introduction:
The third strategic goal “Integrated and Sustainable Environmental System” acknowledges the importance of safeguarding the rights of future generations to the same natural resources. This is in light of the vested interest of Egypt, along with the rest of the world, in environmental preservation, sustainability, and integration.

Egypt's Vision 2030 recognizes that the Egyptian identity has been historically linked to various local environmental systems. Egypt's natural resources have been the foundation of development and civilizational enhancement. Through the ages, the Nile River, the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the valleys and mountains, the abundant resources on land and underground, the variety of living things, as well as the climate have been sources of livelihood, prosperity, and civilization.

This goal reflects the global developmental trend that calls for preserving natural resources in their ecological and biological diversity. It emphasizes the need to curb excessive use and raises concerns about the consequences of unsustainable consumption linked to development activities in sectors such as agriculture, fishing, mining, tourism, and transportation. Consumption in these sectors has grown due to the increase in production and advances in technology, leading to air, water, and soil pollution as well as harm to all forms of life.

Within this framework, this strategic goal is intricately linked and intertwined with the SDGs on a global scale. It considers the preservation of the environment and natural resources against depletion or degradation while promoting the reliance on alternative renewable resources. This aligns with SDG2: Zero Hunger; SDG6: Clean Water and Sanitation; SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production; SDG 13: Climate Action; SDG 14: Life Below Water and SDG 15: Life on Land. It is also consistent with goals six and seven of the first aspiration of Africa Agenda 2063 “A Prosperous Africa, based on Inclusive Growth and Sustainable Development". Moreover, this strategic goal aligns with Egypt's environmental policy safeguarded by the Egyptian constitution that stipulates

91

“Every individual has the right to live in a healthy, sound, and balanced environment. Its protection is a national duty. The state is committed to taking the necessary measures to preserve it, avoid harming it, rationally use its natural resources to ensure that sustainable development is achieved, and guarantee the rights of future generations thereto”.

Thus, there is an international, regional, and national consensus on the crucial role of the sustainable management of environmental systems and natural resources. This is evident in Egypt's commitment as a party to numerous international agreements concerning the environment and addressing climate change, as well as the resulting obligations.

Several factors underscore the necessity of incorporating this strategic goal into the development agenda, including the rapid population growth and the mounting pressure it exerts on natural resources, as well as environmental degradation. Other factors comprise the escalating impacts of climate change and the harm inflicted on various environmental systems. In addition to advancements in modern technologies, innovations, and scientific knowledge, allowing for more efficient natural resource utilization and promoting sustainability. Furthermore, the emergence of natural disasters and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, vividly demonstrates the critical need to protect vulnerable sectors and environments and build resilience.

Egypt's Vision 2030 relies on Guiding Principles to achieve this strategic goal. Firstly, it places "Human-Centered Development” at its core, considering the surrounding environment of the Egyptian citizen in all its forms. Secondly, it aims to achieve “Equity and Accessibility” by ensuring that all citizens benefit from the fruits of development even across generations. Thirdly, it emphasizes "Resilience and Adaptation" acknowledging the importance of promptly addressing and handling any emergent or unexpected changes. Lastly, it strives for achieving “Sustainability” to support economic growth while preserving and optimizing the use of natural resources.

The Vision offers a number of Enablers to accomplish this objective, mainly “Financing” through incentive policies aimed at encouraging private sector investment, production, and consumption, and involving the adoption of economic models like the circular economy and the green economy to enhance added value. Furthermore, “Technology and Innovation” utilizes modern scientific tools, training, and qualification to enhance environmental products and boost the competitiveness of local goods. "Supportive Legislative and Institutional Environment” is also important for formulating necessary legislation to improve natural resource management and implement effective control measures for rationalizing utilization, in line with international standards. Another enabler is "Data Generation and Availability" which involves the ability to analyze historical data and generate future scenarios that inform the country's plans.

The strategic goal of achieving “Integrated and Sustainable Environmental System” is realized through four general goals, namely: “Facing Climate Change Challenges”; “Sustainability of Natural Resources”; “Preserving Biodiversity and Ensuring the Sustainability of Ecological Systems”; and "Waste Management”. These general goals encompass a set of targets and enabling policies, along with quantitative indicators for performance monitoring and evaluation.

# 1. Facing Climate Change Challenges
Climate change refers to the global alterations in weather phenomena characterized by the rise in average temperatures, coupled with changes in the statistical distribution of weather patterns. International organizations have paid significant attention to climate change issues due to their profound developmental implications, affecting various aspects of life. The consequences of climate change manifest in the increased frequency of extreme weather events, including changes in rainfall patterns, heightened storm intensity and frequency, droughts, floods, and fluctuating rainfall rates. This directly impacts water resource availability, contributes to sea level rise, extensive

coastal inundation, and desertification. Moreover, climate change negatively affects biodiversity and, consequently, disrupting the ecological equilibrium.

Climate change is associated with numerous adverse impacts on economic sectors. In the short term, these effects arise from the increased frequency of extreme weather events that lead to human and material losses. In the medium and long term, climate change disrupts global agricultural production areas, affecting livestock and food and water resources; leads to the flooding of low-lying areas; and causes a decline in tourism rates. Subsequently, this results in unemployment, job loss, and various health consequences like the spread of pandemics and diseases that hinder productivity.

## Current Landscape:
Egypt is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to the risks of climate change, due to its geography and location within the arid regions. Egypt is almost fully reliant on the water of the Nile River because of limited rainfall and the densely populated Nile Delta. The northern parts of the Delta face the threat of submersion from rising sea levels in the Mediterranean, as they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of global warming from the planet's high temperatures and the consequential threat of a relative rise in sea levels. Consequently, climate change poses several challenges, notably intensified heatwaves and cold spells, which further strain energy demands and exacerbate the existing gaps in food and water availability.

As for the food gap, climate change is likely to lead to a decline in the productivity of key crops for various reasons. These include the impact of extreme weather events, the type of crops, and environmental factors interacting with them. In addition to shifts in agro- environmental conditions.

Regarding the water gap, the temperature rise increases evaporation, resulting in reduced water availability and high irrigation demands. Additionally, climate change is expected to contribute to

94

20/30

VISION OF EGYPT

---
changes in water sources caused by decreased rainfall and the rising sea levels affecting aquifers in the Nile Delta regions. Consequently, the increased salinity of water renders it unsuitable for use, alongside the construction of dams by upstream countries along the Nile River. These factors disrupt the flow patterns and volume of water reaching Egypt as a downstream nation, thereby adversely affecting its water supply for various purposes (agriculture, drinking, industry, etc.), posing a significant threat to the country's national security. It is noteworthy that Egypt's per capita water share dropped to 599 cubic meters annually in 2017 for its population of approximately 95 million,[26] which falls nearly 50% below international standards. Consequently, Egypt finds itself below the threshold of water poverty.

The climate change issue attracted significant attention with the establishment of the National Council for Climate Change, presided by the Prime Minister. Moreover, Egypt launched in 2021 the National Climate Change Strategy 2050, which serves as the guiding framework for addressing the adverse consequences of climate change.

> Egypt's Vision 2030 prioritizes addressing and adapting to the potential repercussions of climate change. This includes implementing essential measures, offering ecosystem services, and establishing financing mechanisms to effectively monitor and mitigate the impact on natural resources, coastal regions, and biodiversity.

## Means for Goal Attainment:
*   Supporting institutional development, capacity building, and technical expertise enhancement in the field of climate change. In addition to, improving the efficiency of modern technology utilization. As well as, developing skilled personnel and technical expertise in environmental departments across the governorates.

• Implementing and activating environmental sustainability standards to increase the proportion of green projects in the national investment plan.

# 2. Sustainability of Natural Resources
Sustainability of natural resources refers to the ability to continue utilizing these resources efficiently in the long run without compromising the rights of future generations. This is directly tied to the overarching objective of sustainable development reflected in meeting the present generation's needs while preserving the rights of future generations to natural resources and development. Moreover, the availability of energy and water resources is fundamental for providing the components for attaining national sustainable development.

## Current Landscape:
Over the past two decades, Egypt has placed significant attention to the preservation of natural resources. Measures have been taken to legislate the conservation of these resources and affirm the integration of the development sectors. The key elements related to the sustainability of resources are water resources, natural and artificial lakes, agricultural resources and lands, and fossil fuels including petroleum and natural gas. These resources are closely and directly linked to water, food, and energy security.

With regards to water resources, Egypt is currently suffering from water scarcity. The country's total annual water needs amount to approximately 114 billion cubic meters, whereas the available water resources only reach around 60 billion cubic meters annually. Consequently, Egypt experienced a water deficit about 21 billion cubic meters in 2020. In addition, Egypt imports crops equivalent to approximately 34 billion cubic meters of virtual water. This brings the total water gap to 55 billion cubic meters annually. [27] This gap is expected to further widen due to population growth, economic development, and insufficient renewable water resources.

Egypt has already crossed the water poverty threshold of 1,000 cubic meters per person annually, as the per capita allocation of renewable freshwater reached around 599 cubic meters annually in 2017 for a population of approximately 95 million people. [28] If Egypt's population reaches 150 million people by 2030, per capita share is expected to decrease to 400 cubic meters annually. [29] Hence, there are two approaches to enhance the efficiency of Egypt's water resources. Firstly, the rationalization of water usage and recycling, especially in the agricultural sector, which accounted for approximately 76% of water usage in the year 2019. [30] Secondly, explore alternative water sources such as desalination, wastewater treatment and reuse, and rainwater harvesting. Measures have already been implemented to reuse good quality drainage water to meet water needs, with the estimated total volume of reused water currently standing at approximately 21 billion cubic meters annually.[31]

Natural and artificial lakes are sources of fisheries that ensure food security and offer employment and income opportunities for the residents of nearby areas. However, the majority of the northern lakes (Maryut, Idku, Burullus, Manzala) are shrinking in size and suffer from excessive pollution from

drainage systems due to urban expansion, depletion, and land reclamation for agriculture. This has led to increased sedimentation from drains, blockage of straits, and rising lakebed levels. Similarly, many southern lakes (Qarun, Wadi El Rayan, among others) are also suffering from encroachments, resulting in a significant loss of their ecological value.

Concerning agricultural lands, preserving their area can be achieved by halting encroachments, addressing land degradation and erosion, and upgrading the irrigation and drainage systems. According to official data from CAPMAS, Egypt's total cultivated area reached 16.2 million feddans in 2018/19. If properly cultivated, this area can contribute to achieving a higher rate of self-sufficiency. Moreover, agricultural lands suffer from deterioration caused by intensive farming practices, driven by policies that overlook the rational and regulated use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers, in addition to increased rates of construction and encroachment.

Regarding traditional energy sources, the petroleum sector has developed reserves by intensifying research and exploration activities, as well as increasing the production of crude oil and natural gas. The peak production of petroleum wealth was reached in Egypt in August 2019, and self-sufficiency in locally produced natural gas was achieved by the end of September 2018. Egypt emerged as one of the leading suppliers of liquefied gas between 2015 and 2017. Additionally, it successfully solidified its position as a major player in the gas sector, ranking second in North Africa and the Middle East and 14th globally in natural gas production in 2020, after ranking 18th globally in 2015.

Electricity production witnessed continuous growth after the introduction of new combined-cycle power plants, the enhancement of power generator efficiency through natural gas, and the increased utilization of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, both in electricity production and seawater desalination. This in addition to the nearly full exploitation of hydroelectric energy potential and exploring the feasibility of incorporating various new energy sources like hydrogen (blue and green). These efforts have led to an abundance of electrical energy.

Egypt also aims to enhance energy efficiency by developing networks and lighting systems, promoting the use of energy-saving devices among citizens, and providing incentives for the private sector.

Therefore, Egypt's Vision 2030 prioritizes the efficient utilization of all natural resources of the country, both traditional and renewable, including beaches and natural reserves, while maintaining their sustainability and adopting practices that safeguard the rights of future generations. This Vision necessitates a transformative adaptation of natural resources to effectively respond to various environmental advancements.

## Means for Goal Attainment:
• Developing an integrated water resource management system and expanding treated wastewater reuse to diversify supply sources, increase water resources, rationalize water use, and enhance agricultural and irrigation water quality.
• Exploring non-traditional water sources like desalination for tourism and domestic purposes and utilizing rain and flood for irrigation.
• Enhancing electricity generation, transmission, and distribution efficiency to reduce fuel consumption and emissions from power plants.
• Implementing sustainable transport concepts to reduce fuel consumption in the transportation sector, and transitioning to cleaner technologies like natural gas, electricity, and hydrogen.

# 3. Preserving Biodiversity and Ensuring the Sustainability of Ecological System

Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth, encompassing diverse living species of plants
and animals found on land and in water as a cohesive unit that connects the environment and
society, where humans play an active and complementary role to ecosystems. Ecosystems, in turn,
are dynamic equilibria within a community of organisms to maintain the relationship that shields
their existence against changes or disturbances that lead to the disruption of the entire ecological
system.

Biodiversity is the foundation that sustains all life forms by providing clean air, water, and food. It
also impacts human health and helps combat natural diseases; in addition to being a source where
medicines derive from. It also contributes to the mitigation of climate change.

## Current Landscape:

Egypt is recognized as a leading nation in protecting biodiversity, whether by actively participating
in international agreements aimed at protecting and preserving natural resources, or by adopting
and implementing a national strategy and action plan dedicated to the preservation of biodiversity
over the past two decades, with active involvement from the government, civil society, and the
general public.

Egypt possesses exceptional environmental resources and natural reserves, which are home to a
multitude of plant and animal species, some of which have existed for millions of years. Numerous
economic sectors, such as agriculture, industry, fishing, and tourism, directly and indirectly contribute
to the country's GDP through biological resources and genetic assets that are exclusive to Egypt.

Egypt, like the rest of the world, faces risks associated with the decline of biodiversity across multiple
ecosystems. Despite numerous national efforts to preserve natural and biological resources and
set sustainable use controls, global indicators have shown that about 25% of animal and plant
species - which have been assessed in the recent global evaluation on biodiversity are at risk
of extinction.[32] The existing global biodiversity faces the imminent threat of extinction within the
next two to three decades.

Egypt is renowned for being home to a massive number of plants and animals thriving in diverse
ecosystems, but many animal species are currently endangered by extinction, with many more
expected to follow in the future. Therefore, it is crucial to protect this diversity from any form of
pollution or degradation caused by climate change, population growth, unsustainable practices in
agriculture and industry, urban expansion, and tourism and marine activities, posing an accelerated
threat to biological species.

Therefore, Egypt's Vision 2030 is committed to conserving its diverse ecosystems, protecting
biodiversity, sustaining the ecological balance of Egyptian lands and waters, and maintaining
endemic and endangered species.

## Means for Goal Attainment:

• Advocating for the preservation and sustainable use of resources, minimizing the disruption
of biodiversity. As well as, focusing on ecosystems with limited adaptability and susceptible to
external pressures worldwide, such as highly significant coral reefs and migratory birds, which
serve as essential attractions for ecotourism.

managing sites that are particularly important for biodiversity and ecological processes. In addition
to, preserving these reserves from main threats such as land-use changes, urban development,
fishing, invasive species, pollution, waste, and inappropriate economic activities expansion.
• Improving the efficiency of managing natural reserves to ensure their viability and financial
sustainability.
• Engaging local communities in managing natural resources within reserves, encouraging and
training them to improve the quality of their environmental products, and supporting their
marketing to create job opportunities and increase income for community members.
• Encouraging school trips to natural reserves and transforming them into cultural, educational,
and recreational centers.
• Documenting and protecting the traditional knowledge of local communities, along with
maintaining their intellectual property rights, as outlined in international environmental agreements
signed by Egypt.

Environment. The goal is to transform reserves into attractions for both international and domestic
tourism, connecting them to surrounding and local communities, and boosting their income to
ensure financial sustainability.
• Enhancing scientific and technical capabilities to support research efforts, and ensuring the
availability of data for environmental and ecological impact assessments, particularly in relation to
economic projects.

# 4. Waste Management

Waste management is the monitoring, collection, transportation, treatment, and recycling or
disposal of waste resulting from human activities. Countries adopt waste management to mitigate
the adverse impacts of waste on the environment, health, and overall appearance. While also
aiming for economic benefits through the implementation of a hierarchical concept, i.e., reducing
waste through recycling and innovative utilization methods to recover its economic value.

Waste management is linked to the concept of circular economy that relies on waste management
not only as a crucial resource for recycling operations, but also as a means to combat resource
depletion and continuous consumption of natural resources. It also creates opportunities for new
job opportunities, known as green jobs, and reduces the use of resource inputs to the bare minimum.
This minimizes pollution, waste generation, and carbon emissions that lead to global warming and
ultimately climate change, and it diminishes the volume of waste disposed of in sanitary landfills,

thereby extending their lifespan. Moreover, circular business models offer products and services with higher profitability, in contrast to the linear models commonly employed in manufacturing processes.

## Current Landscape:
Solid waste sector is divided into six sub-sectors, sharing similar features while differing in treatment methods. Waste includes municipal solid waste, construction and demolition waste, waste from healthcare facilities, non-hazardous industrial waste, hazardous waste, and agricultural residues.

Each waste type is further categorized into sub-systems in terms of collection and transportation methods, recycling systems, and final disposal systems. The informal sector and certain civil society organizations undertake the collection of all waste types and stages, with a predominant presence of young workers. Law No. 202 of 2020 on Waste Management and its Executive Regulations was issued to serve as a general framework for planning and preparing relevant strategies, ensuring that planning is closely linked to financing, and establishing necessary policies. A key policy is the implementation of extended responsibility for waste generators to handle specific types of waste, as well as clearly defining the roles, responsibilities, and stakeholders involved in integrated waste management, and ensuring the continuity of required financial resource .[33] According to estimates from the Ministry of Environment, 14.8% of collected municipal solid waste is recycled using environmentally sound methods (biomechanical treatment).

# Introduction:
The strategic goal of a "Diversified, Knowledge-based, and Competitive Economy” embodies the economic perspective of Egypt's Vision 2030.

A diversified economy signifies the capacity of various sectors to generate income, manage resources, and create employment opportunities across industrial, agricultural, and service fields. This approach ensures that growth and development are not confined to a single sector; thus providing multiple income sources and granting the country the flexibility to confront diverse crises and disruptions.

A knowledge-based economy is an economy built on innovation driven by research and development. It relies on an efficient system that connects educational and scientific research institutions with economic sectors. To achieve this, the presence of information infrastructure is vital to enable the integration of modern technologies and their adaptation to local requirements.

Competitiveness involves the state's ability to produce goods and services that meet local demands while also competing in regional and global markets. This hinges on crucial elements for a robust economy, including infrastructure, a supportive macroeconomic environment, and factors enhancing efficiency such as education, training, scientific research, technological readiness, and innovation. Consequently, competitiveness serves as a key accelerator for growth and fosters effective and efficient integration with global markets. Hence reflecting the strength of the national economy and its regional and international standing in maximizing both apparent and latent strengths, confronting diverse challenges, and capitalizing on available opportunities.

The pursuit of a “Diversified, Knowledge-based, and Competitive Economy” aligns with the SDGs, and underscores Egypt's vision with the global perspectives, thereby bolstering the state's endeavors

to align with international visions and strategies. Specifically, this strategic goal correlates with SDG8: “Decent Work and Economic Growth”, SDG9: “Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure” and SDG12: "Responsible Consumption and Production”. Moreover, it aligns with the fifth, sixth, and seventh goals of the first aspiration in Africa Agenda 2063, “A Prosperous Africa, based on Inclusive Growth and Sustainable Development”, as well as the twentieth goal of the seventh aspiration, "Africa as a strong, united, resilient and influential global player and partner".

In the national context, the strategic objective aligns with the economic goals stipulated and safeguarded by the Egyptian Constitution, mainly "achieving prosperity in the country through sustainable development and social justice to guarantee an increase in the real growth rate of the national economy, raising the standard of living, increasing job opportunities, reducing unemployment rates and eliminating poverty,” in addition to "Economic production, service-based and information-based activities are key components of the national economy. The state commits to protecting them, increasing their competitiveness, providing an environment that attracts investment, and works on increasing production, encouraging exports, and regulating imports".

This strategic goal reflects as well recent developments witnessed in the Egyptian economy in recent years, which have influenced various facets of life, particularly the implementation of the National Program for Economic and Social Reform. This program embraces financial, monetary, and structural reforms, all aimed at bolstering confidence in the Egyptian economy and facilitating inclusive and sustainable growth that generates positive impacts on citizens by reducing poverty rates, boosting productivity, increasing income levels, enhancing living standards, and creating adequate and decent employment opportunities, while achieving financial and monetary stability.

The realization of Egypt's Vision 2030 is closely linked to the imperative of empowering the private sector to support the development process and foster sustainable economic growth. This involves the government providing robust infrastructure, enhancing the legislative environment,

advocating for fair competition policies, and stimulating and diversifying investments to enhance job opportunities. Additionally, integrating the informal sector into the formal economy by offering various incentives, including facilitating access to financing, fostering innovation, and raising awareness of non-cash transactions.

The general trends of economic indicators show that despite the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Egyptian economy, similar to economies worldwide, the policies implemented under the National Program for Economic and Social Reform have equipped the economy to withstand and mitigate the crisis repercussions. This is evident in the coherence and positive outcomes of economic indicators during 2019/20. Consequently, Egypt's international standing in terms of diversity, knowledge, and competitiveness has improved, with the country's ranking rising in the Economic Complexity Index to 68 out of 133 countries in 2019, compared to 71 in 2018,[34] implying that the Egyptian economy has become more diverse. Moreover, the country's position in the Global Knowledge Index improved by ten places in 2020 compared to the previous year, reaching 72 out of 138 countries.[35] Moreover, Egypt has maintained its position in the Global Competitiveness Index, while making progress in ease of doing business, global innovation, entrepreneurship, and budget transparency indicators.

To enhance the Egyptian economy's diversification and competitiveness, as well as improve macroeconomic indicators, it is crucial to address this strategic goal within the Guiding Principles governing Egypt's Vision 2030, namely -"Human-Centered Development”, “Equity and Accessibility”, "Resilience and Adaptation", and "Sustainability", which are closely intertwined with the general goals.

The various targets of this strategic goal can be achieved through a number of enablers, such as

[34] Economic Complexity Index, the Atlas of Economic Complexity, the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.
[35] The Global Knowledge Index, The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Knowledge Foundation (MBRF).

"financing", "technology and innovation", "digital transformation", "data generation and availability" and "supportive legislative and institutional environment". These enablers play a crucial role across various productive, industrial, and service-related sectors, including the financial and monetary domains.

The strategic goal “Diversified, Knowledge-based, and Competitive Economy” is accomplished through seven general goals, namely, “Fostering Productivity, Diversity, and Value Added", "Improving the Business Environment and Enhancing Competitiveness”, “Increasing Decent Employment Opportunities”, “Shift towards Financial Inclusion”, “Manufacturing Revitalization", "Supporting Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises”, and “Attaining Fiscal Sustainability". Each of these general goals include a suite of enabling policies, coupled with quantitative indicators for performance monitoring and evaluation.

# 1. Fostering Productivity, Diversity, and Value Added

The most advanced nations are highly capable of diversifying their production structures to include industries, agriculture, and services that yield significant added value. This diversity allows them to attain numerous economic advantages and evenly distribute them across various geographical regions.

The Egyptian economy demonstrates a variety of activities encompassing industry, agriculture, trade, tourism, and mining. However, attaining effective economic resource allocation and equitable distribution of development benefits to all segments of society and geographic areas necessitates both vertical depth within different sectors and horizontal expansion across diverse locations. Taking into consideration, environmental and social aspects, as well as the rights of future generations.

116

## Current Landscape:

A scrutiny of the sectoral structure of the Egyptian economy in 2021/22 reveals that manufacturing takes the lead in economic activity, constituting approximately 15.3% of GDP. It is followed by wholesale and retail trade accounting for 13.1%, then agriculture, forestry, and fishing at 10.8%. While real estate activities make up for 10.4%, and extractions at 8.8%. Moreover, social services (education, health, and other services) represent 6%, followed by transportation and storage, communications, the Suez Canal, restaurants, and hotels.

In terms of total investments, commodity activities (including agriculture, manufacturing, extractions, construction, and utilities services) capture about 43.5% of total investments, while social service activities (real estate, education, health, and other services) account for 28.5%. In addition, productive services (including transportation, trade and finance, ICT and tourism) make up 28%. However, there is a pressing need to boost private sector investment and its engagement in these sectors alongside government expenditure. The proportion of private investment as a percentage of total investments has been declining in the previous period, dropping to 28.3% in 2020/21 from 54% in 2015/16.[36] Encouragingly, there has been a resurgence in private investment, reaching 28.7% in 2021/22.

Hence, Egypt's Vision 2030 outlines seven promising sectors that will serve as catalysts for growth, guided by a set of principles and criteria. Foremost is the potential to achieve inclusive growth, enhance private sector engagement, promote interconnectivity with other economic sectors. In addition to generating both direct and indirect employment opportunities, and concentrating on sectors where Egypt possesses distinct competitive advantages. These sectors are:

a) Manufacturing industries sector, given its role as a highly tradeable sector with a significant impact on export growth.
b) Extractive industries sector, given its crucial role in enhancing the competitiveness of the industrial sector.
c) Agricultural sector, for its strategic importance and Labor-intensive nature, hence contributing to reducing unemployment and poverty rates.
d) Communications and technology sector, given its consistent growth and association with other sectors' business cycle.
e) Logistics sector, given its ability to facilitate among and link economic sectors.
f) Tourism sector, for its intricate backward and forward linkages with several other sectors, thereby creating novel employment opportunities.
g) Construction and real estate activities sector, given its unique support to other sectors and its substantial employment generation capacity.

## Means for Goal Attainment:

* Transitioning local economic structures from low-added-value industries to modern and diversified sectors, while ensuring the horizontal expansion of industry. This can be achieved through the development of existing industrial zones and finalization of the construction of industrial complexes, alongside vertical expansion.
* Facilitating private sector investments in targeted sectors through offering incentives that prioritize digital transformation, green economy, and renewable energy.
* Bridging scientific research with developmental sectors to foster innovative and creative production methods. In addition to, converting knowledge and innovation into high-value economic products or services.

# 2. Improving the Business Environment and Enhancing Competitiveness

Given the swift economic fluctuations and intense competition that characterize both regional and global economies, along with the inherent challenges faced by the Egyptian economy in integrating into the global market. It becomes imperative to support the business climate to foster competitiveness, enhance market efficiency, promote economic flexibility, create more employment opportunities, support existing investments, and attract both domestic and foreign investments.

## Current Landscape:

Egypt maintained its rank of 93 out of 141 countries in the Global Competitiveness Index in 2020.[37] However, there was an improvement in the economic complexity index, a comprehensive measure of the country's productive characteristics and knowledge assessing the diversity and development of the industrial and export products. Egypt improved its ranking to 68th out of 133 countries in 2019, compared to 71st in 2018,[38] demonstrating that the Egyptian economy has become more interrelated and diversified.

Furthermore, Egypt demonstrated progress in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, ascending six positions to rank 114 out of 190 countries, compared to 120 in 2019. However, there remains room for improvement in the Global Innovation Index, where Egypt experienced a slight setback in 2020, slipping four positions compared to 2019, placing it at the 96th position out of 131 countries.

To bolster investment, the GoE has implemented various measures, activating incentives outlined in Investment Law No. 72 of 2017. These measures are strategically designed to stimulate both

domestic and foreign direct investments in targeted sectors and most in need governorates. The establishment of investment service centers across different governorates, coupled with automated services, reflect a proactive effort to streamline procedures for investors.

Regarding Egyptian exports, despite a decrease in the trade balance deficit to GDP ratio from 12.6% in 2018/19 to 10.1% in 2019/20, the expected surge in exports following the currency devaluation did not materialize. The ratio of total exports and non-petroleum exports to GDP, declined to approximately 7.3% and 4.9%, respectively, in 2019/20, compared to 9.4% and 5.6% in 2018/19, due to the global pandemic. [39] However, there has been a noteworthy enhancement in the performance of both commodity and service exports, constituting over 15% of the total GDP during 2021/22, a substantial improvement from the 10.6% recorded in 2020/21.

Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to boost highly competitive exports, facilitate access to international markets, and encourage a shift towards exports with high value-added and advanced technological components. Additionally, it seeks to diversify exports, thereby increasing resilience to foreign market fluctuations and positively impacting the trade balance and balance of payments. Moreover, the Vision adopts the expansion of economic activities into global value chains in modern production sectors and leverages technological advancements to access new regional and international markets.

## Means for Goal Attainment:

* Establishing robust procedural and legislative frameworks coupled with adopting an effective and fair competition policy. This is to create a favorable and conducive environment for both local and foreign investments.

embodies a commitment to upholding the fundamental rights of workers, incorporating safety rules, fair and rewarding wages, and social insurance. Moreover, it entails considerations for both physical and mental well-being of individuals in their occupational roles; as well as offering better opportunities for the workers' capacity building and thus social integration.

Given recent technological advancements and their impact on the production process, many current jobs are projected to become obsolete in the future. Technological applications, particularly artificial intelligence, are expected to significantly influence the job landscape. However, it is anticipated that new employment opportunities will emerge to compensate for those that will be phased out.

Therefore, knowledge economies play a crucial role in affirming that humans remain the driving force behind technological development. By continuously developing and building capabilities, and enhancing and aligning skills with development needs, it becomes possible to attain a stronger position in research and innovation within the production process. This, in turn, necessitates increased investment in education, raising the qualifications of graduates of technical schools and universities, and expanding vocational training to supply skilled workers equipped for new jobs, thus contributing to the provision of decent employment opportunities.

## Current Landscape:
The examination of Egypt's labor market structure shows that despite a commendable reduction in the unemployment rate to 7.2% in the final quarter of 2022,[40] marking its lowest point in over a decade, there persist several challenges tied to this metric. Paramount among these challenges are the dwindling labor force participation, a surge in unemployment rates within females and higher education qualifications, an increase in informal sector employment, and irregular forms of employment.

Unemployment, notably concentrated among individuals with higher education levels and the youth category, remains a concern. A noteworthy portion of the Egyptian workforce is entrenched in sectors characterized by low value-added activities, further compounded by the expanding informal economy. This informal sector often fails to meet the conditions for decent work, encompassing safety, occupational health, job security, and social and health insurance.

Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to provide secure, decent, and productive employment opportunities. It strives to increase employment rates, particularly among youth, women, and people with disabilities. It also seeks to establish a work environment that ensures safety and security for all workers, safeguards their rights, and extends health and social welfare to irregular workers. Furthermore, the vision focuses on reducing the size of the informal sector in the economy, all in the context of strengthening the flexibility and effectiveness of the labor market, as well as improving the efficiency and skills of Egyptian workers and enhancing their competitiveness.

## Means for Goal Attainment:
• Enhancing the efficiency of the educational process by developing programs and curricula that closely align with the dynamic needs of the labor market.
• Supporting investment in human capital and developing technological skills in accordance with the latest educational and vocational systems.
• Encouraging the contribution of the private sector and civil society in enhancing the vocational training system's efficiency.
• Increasing public expenditure on research and development while leveraging the outcomes of research and studies.
• Supporting partnerships between the business sector and academic institutions to harness academic innovations, thereby positively influencing the labor market.

• Supporting the institutional and legislative environment for intellectual property and encouraging patents.
• Increasing collaboration and connections with Egyptian scientists abroad to tap into their wealth of expertise.
• Regulating the employment of Egyptian workers abroad, and safeguarding their rights. In addition to, facilitating international accreditation of certificates and professional qualifications for Egyptians seeking work abroad.
• Raising awareness about the significance of occupational safety and health to foster an informed society and prevent severe injuries and accidents.
• Supporting the transition from the informal sector to the formal sector.

# 4. Shift towards Financial Inclusion
Financial inclusion stands as a pivotal objective within the realm of inclusive and comprehensive economic growth, commanding the attention of policymakers, regulatory bodies, and development institutions. This imperative emphasizes the provision of a spectrum of financial services accessible to all segments of the society through formal channels, ensuring both quality and affordability. At its core, financial inclusion strives to safeguard the rights of beneficiaries, empowering them to adeptly manage their financial affairs.

The purpose of financial inclusion is to ensure that no individual, institution, social segment, or those with limited income, as well as owners of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), are left out of the state's financial system. It enables individuals and institutions to access a diverse array of affordable financial products and services tailored to their specific needs.

Notably, the financial inclusion rate in Egypt has surged to 56.2% in December 2021,[41] marking an impressive growth rate of 115% compared to 2016. Moreover, there has been a substantial uptick in the loan portfolio designated for medium, small, and micro-sized projects, reaching a substantial EGP 315 billion between the end of December 2015 and December 2021.[42] The state is also committed to providing non-banking financial services and introducing new financing options, like venture capital funds, to support small business owners and start-ups.

Nevertheless, these commendable efforts are not without challenges, particularly concerning the status of infrastructure and technology for mobile networks and the internet. These challenges hinder the application of financial services in financially-excluded sectors, particularly in remote areas. Consequently, these challenges impede the optimal efficiency of attaining comprehensive financial inclusion in Egypt. Adding to the complexity, is the prevalent low level of financial literacy, evident in insufficient awareness and certain societal beliefs that dissuade certain segments from engaging with the financial or banking sector. Instead, they often resort to informal arrangements for their financial transactions.

Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to further enhance financial inclusion rates and achieve economic empowerment through a system that offers fair, high-quality, and cost-effective financial products and services to all segments of society.

# 6. Supporting Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
Medium-sized, small and micro enterprises (MSMEs), entrepreneurs, and startups stand as pivotal pillars supporting the country's economic activity. Their distinctive feature lies in their adaptability to economic shifts and their evolution in tandem with technological advancements in production processes. No longer confined to traditional methods, these ventures embrace digital transformation and technology, incorporating innovative ideas from entrepreneurs and startups. This dynamic sector presents substantial and rapid growth opportunities, with the potential to access both local and international markets. The overarching goal is to foster the development of new products and services characterized by enhanced efficiency and heightened competitiveness.

## Current Landscape:
In recent years, the contribution of MSMEs enterprises in the GDP has witnessed a significant surge, recording 43%. This comes in addition to an increase in its contribution to the workforce, specifically within wholesale and retail trade and the services sector.

When considering the distribution of employment within these establishments, approximately 48% of employees are engaged in trading and services, while only 24.19% work in manufacturing. The sector exhibits a strong inclination towards the establishment of micro-enterprises (employing up to five individuals), along with a decline in the percentage of medium-sized enterprises.

In the economic census of 2017/18, the number of non-governmental establishments totaled approximately 3.8 million, with micro-enterprises representing a staggering 92%, small enterprises accounting for around 6%, and medium and large enterprises constituting a mere 2%. This is associated with the weak connections between the sector and major projects, in addition to lacking the necessary linkages between these projects and large factories. Small and medium enterprises should ideally play a prominent role as complementary industries and production inputs for the

130

requirements of larger enterprises by supplying them with essential work components, thus helping in the integration of value and supply chains within the production process. This is also accompanied by a substantial presence of the informal sector, which encompasses approximately 53% of private sector establishments and primarily operates in economic activities with low added value and has limited export capacity.[46]

The state is proactively engaged in the formalization of the informal sector, employing a multifaceted approach that includes facilitations, as well as tax and non-tax incentives outlined in the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) Development Law No. 152 of 2020. This comprehensive legal framework also incorporates incentives tailored for companies and establishments that contribute to the development of small, micro, and startup enterprises.

In the realm of entrepreneurial ventures, Egypt has the fastest-growing environment for supporting entrepreneurship in the Middle East and North Africa, as reported by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. Over four years, Egypt has ascended approximately 10 positions in the Global Entrepreneurship Index released by the International Institute for Entrepreneurship Development, moving from a global ranking of 91 in 2015 to 81 in 2019 among 137 countries. Despite these commendable advancements, persistent challenges related to opportunity realization, risk-taking, competitiveness, and innovation, along with limited financing options, often prompt entrepreneurs to stop operating.

Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to establish a clear and consistent policy that creates an enabling environment for these projects to achieve high growth rates. Additionally, it seeks to foster a culture of entrepreneurship, offer technical support to enhance administrative, productive, and innovative capabilities, facilitate access to credit and financing guarantees, and assist

# 7. Attaining Fiscal Sustainability
The state's fiscal sustainability reflects its capacity to adopt a durable financial strategy that stands as a foundation for economic stability. It entails the ability to sustain existing spending and revenue policies in the long run without compromising financial solvency or risking the inability to meet future financial obligations. The primary sources of funding for the country's SDGs are derived from taxes, non-tax revenues, and domestic savings.

133

20/30

## Current Landscape:
The GoE prioritizes achieving fiscal sustainability through setting priorities and working on enhancing investment efficiency and government spending. This serves as the main source of financing for education, health, infrastructure, and social security networks, while increasing revenues, particularly real revenue.

Notably, the total public revenues from the GDP constituted 17% in 2021/22, exhibiting an increase from previous year's value of approximately 16.1% in 2020/21. In addition, public spending, stood at 23.1% of GDP in 2021/22, slightly up from 22.9% in 2020/21. This contributed to a decrease in the overall deficit as a percentage of GDP, marking 6.1% in 2021/22 compared to 6.8% in 2020/21.[47]

Regarding public debt, a notable reduction occurred over the past four years, with the debt-to-GDP ratio diminishing from 101% in 2016/17 to 84.6% in 2020/21, experiencing a slight uptick to 87.2% in 2021/22.

Undoubtedly, tax revenues have been the most significant, stable, and sustainable sources of government income, surpassing 70% of total revenues[48] since 2015/16. In comparison, grants and foreign aid are limited options, and semi-rentier revenue sources are unstable and susceptible to external factors. Recent data indicate a downward trend in tax revenues over the past years. Data shows a declining trend in tax revenues over the past years from 14.2% in 2017/18 to 13.8% in 2018/19, then to 12.6% in 2019/20. These percentages are below both the emerging markets' average (19.7% in 2020)[49] and the average across African countries (16.6% in 2019), where data shows an upward trend in Africa's tax revenue-to-GDP ratio since 2010.[50]

This was accompanied by a slight rise in the ratio of income taxes to GDP, which reached 1.7% in 2019/20, compared to about 1.6%.[51] Egypt also made progress in the international index of budget transparency, climbing to the 61st position out of 117 countries in 2019 from its previous rank of 65th in 2017.[52]

Egypt's Vision 2030 aims at enhancing the current tax management system and increasing its efficiency, raising the contribution of real resources to total government resources, and curbing tax evasion. That is in addition to mobilizing local resources, introducing new revenue sources, fostering private sector engagement, and simplifying rules to attract more small enterprises into the formal sector.

## Means for Goal Attainment:
* Raising tax awareness and expanding the tax base by simplifying the tax system, reducing the informal sector, and increasing the contribution of SMEs to tax revenues.
* Enhancing the digital transformation system for electronic collection of all tax types, customs, insurance, pensions, and real estate monthly proceeds in order to minimize tax evasion.
* Extending the implementation of the gender-responsive program and performance budgeting, to ensure public spending efficiency, and foster inclusive welfare for all societal groups without discrimination.
* Encouraging innovative financing methods and diversify funding sources for state projects.
* Rationalizing Government Expenditure to generate additional resources without compromising essential spending priorities.

# Introduction:
The strategic goal of “Well-Developed Infrastructure” underscores the pivotal role that Egypt's Vision 2030 assigns to addressing the needs of the household sector and all economic sectors. These needs include basic necessities like energy, electricity, water, sanitation, as well as networks such as, roads, bridges, ports, and airports. The ambit also extends to communication and information systems, fostering an investment-friendly environment, establishing an advanced industrial base, and bolstering the competitiveness of the national economy.

Infrastructure is defined as the internal facilities that enable economic activity, and promote economic development by streamlining production and distribution processes. Overtime, the concept of infrastructure has evolved. Previously, it was limited to roads and some essential public goods, while currently it transformed into a holistic paradigm of state-provided high-quality services aimed at elevating living standards and ensuring equal opportunities. This encompasses sustainable energy, safe transportation networks, communication systems, and digital infrastructure fostering connectivity across all geographic regions.

The strategic goal of "Well-Developed Infrastructure” aligns seamlessly with the SDGs, particularly SDG6: "Clean Water and Sanitation”, SDG7: “Affordable and Clean Energy", and SDG11: “Sustainable Cities and Communities”. Furthermore, it resonates with the first goal in the first aspiration of Africa Agenda 2063, "A high standard of living, quality of life, and well-being for all", and the tenth goal in the second aspiration “World class infrastructure criss-crosses Africa”.

Within this context, Egypt places paramount importance on optimizing the advantages of its unique geographical location. This involves facilitating international trade and establishing cutting-edge logistical, commercial, and industrial zones. The objective is to propel economic growth, promoting both domestic and foreign investments by ensuring the requisite infrastructure readiness for projects, whether in expansive industrial complexes across various Egyptian governorates, or in new cities.

Furthermore, Egypt has witnessed a remarkable transformation in its infrastructure landscape over the past five years. This evolution is evidenced by a twofold increase in electrical capacity, the fortification of water and sanitation networks. As well as, the strategic execution of projects within the national road network to interconnect Egypt's governorates and establish transverse axes along the Nile, and concrete bridges as viable alternatives to ferries. That is in addition to substantial expansions in Greater Cairo's subway lines, and the development of an electric train system. In parallel, significant improvements have been implemented in the control networks governing transportation, traffic, as well as air and maritime navigation.

Concurrently, vast tracts of land have been allocated with utilities in new communities such as the New Administrative Capital, New Alamein City, New Mansoura City, and New Damietta City. This strategic allocation extends to industrial complexes like Robiki and the Murgam Complex in Alexandria, alongside other industrial hubs distributed across Egypt's governorates.

Moreover, the strategic implementation of major projects in communications, information technology, and both submarine and terrestrial cables has played a pivotal role in mitigating the adverse effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This underscored the imperative for an advanced digital infrastructure, aligned with the transformative needs of diverse state sectors during lockdowns, necessitating the adoption of precautionary measures to curtail the virus's spread.

These concerted efforts have resulted in a substantial elevation in Egypt's global standing. Notably, Egypt ascended 12 positions in the Access to Markets and Infrastructure Index of the Global Economic Openness Index, securing the 88th position globally out of 157 countries in 2020.[53] Additionally, strides have been made in the Infrastructure Index in the Global Competitiveness Report, progressing from the 56th position out of 140 countries in 2018 to the 52nd position out

of 141 countries in 2019.[54] This positive trajectory serves as a pivotal factor in attracting foreign investments.

The pursuit of a "Well- Developed Infrastructure” harmonizes with the guiding principles underpinning the national Vision, underscoring "Human-Centered Development". It emphasizes that the enhancement of quality of life and the elevation of living standards hinge on the promotion of justice in service distribution through the principles of "Equity and Accessibility". This necessitates a proactive approach in elevating readiness by fostering “Resilience and Adaptation” while adhering to the principle of achieving "Sustainability". These guiding principles ensure the provision of all services at a commendable quality without compromising the needs of future generations.

Several enablers contribute to achieving this strategic goal, mainly “financing” that ensures the necessary financial resources for implementing infrastructure projects. In addition, “technology and innovation” that calls for embracing modern sciences, such as using artificial intelligence and the green economy to provide essential services and “digital transformation” that supports the automation and accessibility of services while enhancing their quality. As well as, the “supportive legislative and institutional environment” that contributes to activating modern contractual frameworks that support partnerships between the government and the private sector in infrastructure projects. Moreover, “population growth control” to strike a balance between development and population growth.

The strategic goal of "Well-Developed Infrastructure" crystallizes through the pursuit of four general goals: "Providing Basic and Adequate Services”, “Providing Secure and Sustainable Transportation Systems", "Promoting Sustainable Energy Resources and Systems”, and “Developing Communication and Information Systems”. Each general goal is delineated by a set of targets and requisite enabling policies, accompanied by quantitative indicators meticulously designed to monitor and evaluate performance, ensuring the systematic progress toward the envisioned outcomes.

# 1. Providing Basic and Adequate Services
Within the framework of Egypt's Vision 2030, the intrinsic link between the availability of basic and adequate services—such as energy, electricity, water, and sanitation—and the fulfillment of the diverse needs of citizens and productive sectors across all geographical regions is acknowledged. This nexus bears direct and indirect economic and social ramifications.

## Current Landscape:
The past four years have witnessed substantial strides in the electricity sector's capacity to ensure that the requirements of all developmental and service sectors are met. This was particularly imperative following the energy supply shortages experienced between 2012 and 2014. A comprehensive enhancement of the electricity infrastructure unfolded across the nation, interconnecting regions of production and distribution with those of storage and consumption. New stations were established, and transmission and distribution networks underwent significant upgrades and fortification. The sources of fuel for electricity production were diversified, coupled with improved investments in research and exploration to augment reserves and amplify production.

These concerted efforts yielded marked improvements in the availability and quality of electricity services. As of 2019, approximately 99.7% of the population benefited from electricity services,[55] and instances of power outages were substantially reduced in various regions of the country. Nevertheless, there remains a need for further diversification in the structure of electricity production. Around 88.2% of electricity was generated from thermal systems in 2021/22, with only approximately 11.8% originating from renewable energy sources during the same period.[56] Consequently, the state is committed to elevating the share of renewable energy in electricity generation, aligning with environmental sustainability imperatives.

To catalyze investment in renewable energy sectors, regulatory, technical, and contractual frameworks have been introduced. This includes operation codes for electricity transmission and distribution networks, regulations for connecting wind and solar power stations to the national grid, and the implementation of the independent producer mechanism in contracts with investors. Additionally, strides have been taken to initiate the electricity interconnection project with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, aimed at exchanging 3000 megawatts between the two nations.

Furthermore, there has been a notable expansion in the provision of natural gas to houses as a viable alternative to gas bottles. Since the commencement of operations in 1981, approximately 13.5 million housing units have been connected, benefiting over 60 million citizens. The last four years witnessed a record annual rate of providing natural gas to houses, achieving an impressive 1.2 million units annually.

The number of fueling stations for liquid fuels (gasoline and diesel) has surged across governorates. A remarkable upswing and rapid proliferation of natural gas fueling stations have occurred, quadrupling in numbers over the past year and a half. The construction of 850 stations has been completed, with preparations and implementation underway for the remaining stations, aiming to reach a total of 1000 stations. To further serve the local market and enhance infrastructure investment, marketing companies are actively encouraged to establish new refueling stations.

The water sector, a key priority of Egypt's Vision 2030, poses a challenge to comprehensive development efforts, especially in the face of persistent population growth and the resulting competition for limited water resources. Consequently, this impedes the realization of economic and social development plans. Egypt's total water needs are estimated at around 114 billion cubic meters annually, whereas available water resources stand at approximately 60 billion cubic meters annually. The water deficit reached about 21 billion cubic meters in 2020, compounded by the importation of crops equivalent to water usage (virtual water) estimated at around 34 billion cubic meters annually, resulting in a total water gap of 55 billion cubic meters annually.[57] This state is

categorized as water scarcity, intensifying with the rise in population growth rates.

As highlighted in the third strategic goal, the per capita share of renewable freshwater was 599 cubic meters annually in 2017 for a population of approximately 95 million people.[58] However, this led to a decline in Egypt's rank in the Water Supply Reliability Index -as part of the Global Competitiveness Index- from the 69th position in 2018 to the 73rd position in 2019.[59] Projections suggest that the per capita share of water will continue to decline. It is expected to reach 444 cubic meters annually, surpassing the water poverty threshold, if Egypt's population reaches 128 million people by 2030.[60]

As part of the state's efforts to address water-related challenges, a long-term strategy has been developed to enhance water resources and ensure their availability across all sectors. This strategy has successfully accomplished:

* Around 200 projects aimed at harvesting rainwater and floods in Sinai have been established, along with artificial ground reservoirs and dams, to collect precipitation. These measures will contribute an additional 100 million cubic meters of water to reach a total of 1.4 billion cubic meters by 2030.
* To enhance the performance of water supply systems and ensure access to clean drinking water for citizens, a network of 2,730 drinking water stations has been put into operation. Additionally, 582 cranes have been installed at 3,293 locations nationwide. Together, these facilities have a collective daily production capacity of 30.1 million cubic meters, which corresponds to 85.8% of surface water, 11.7% of groundwater, and 2.5% of desalinated water. These improvements have resulted in the expansion of the water network to a length of 166,000 kilometers, with approximately 98% of

residential areas now having access to safe drinking water, reaching 100% coverage rate in urban areas and 97.7% in rural areas in 2019. [61]

* Seawater desalination plants have been expanded in coastal regions with a high concentration on resorts and tourist villages, capitalizing on Egypt's extensive coastline spanning approximately 2,400 kilometers. These plants utilize solar energy to meet their electricity requirements. To date, 58 stations have been completed and 16 more are under construction, with a total capacity of 640,000 cubic meters per day and a cost of EGP 9.5 billion; while an additional 16 stations with a total expenditure of EGP 12.8 billion will be operational by 2022. By motivating private sector participation and encouraging the implementation of desalination plants, it is projected that an extra 650 million cubic meters of desalinated water can be added to the water balance, ultimately reaching 1 billion cubic meters by 2030.
* The canals have been lined and the efficiency of drainage network has been enhanced to cater to the agricultural and industrial sectors' requirements and combat pollution to improve and safeguard water quality. As a result, Egypt's ranking in the percentage of the population exposed to unsafe drinking water index improved from 71st position in 2018 to 53rd position in 2019. [62]
* Regarding the sanitation sector, nationwide coverage in 2019 reached approximately 68%, with 96% coverage in urban areas and 40% in rural areas. The goal is to implement several projects to install domestic septic tanks and sewage connections, while simultaneously improving and enhancing the efficiency of sanitation services, to achieve 100% coverage in urban areas and increase the coverage rate in rural ones.

This goal is based on the premise that independent and effective judicial authorities are responsible for establishing and enforcing the law, including holding officials and state institutions legally accountable. Achieving this goal relies on the presence of independent oversight authorities capable of performing their responsibilities of accountability and supervision. Consequently, the importance of this goal manifests in updating fundamental laws and enhancing legal awareness among the majority of the population. Additionally, it is reflected in implementing diverse forms of official and social accountability systems through oversight entities, to establish the foundations for a successful judicial system in Egypt.

## Current Landscape:
Egypt is characterized by a robust institutional regulatory framework consisting of independent bodies that exercise oversight and accountability roles, including the Administrative Control Authority, the Accountability State Authority, and parliamentary committees. On the other hand, the lack of availability of reports from some oversight bodies on the government's performance to the public hinders the effectiveness of social accountability mechanisms in Egypt. Additionally, the delayed issuance of the Freedom of Information Act, which enables the disclosure of data and information, negatively impacts the accountability process of the executive authority. Furthermore, there is a weakness in the local accountability due to the absence of elected local councils since 2011. The state also lacks an adequate and developed number of judicial spaces, qualified judges, and lawyers, while most citizens lack awareness about the judicial system.

Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to strengthen the principles of accountability and responsibility through the rule of law, which entails the presence of an independent judiciary that upholds justice, integrity, and equality.

# Means for Goal Attainment:
* Establishing the foundations of open government and accountability. In addition to, completing the transition towards performance-based budgeting.
* Developing social accountability systems, such as participatory budgeting, monitoring government expenditures, and involving citizens in the planning process.
* Strengthening accountability measures for local executive authorities through elected local councils.
* Completing the development of courts' infrastructure -including ICT infrastructure- and the automation of judicial services, in addition to raising public awareness about litigation procedures.
* Strengthening constitutional and legal culture among citizens.

# 4. Empowering Local Administration
The process of empowering local administration involves the development of the legal framework for the local governance system, which divides functions and activities between the central and local levels in a consistent manner. Capacity building, along with the restructuring of administrative and functional aspects of both central and local institutions, in accordance with their new mandates, are integral to this process. This includes the development of local planning and financing systems, alongside supporting financial control mechanisms at both the central and local levels.

# Current Landscape:
Local authorities in Egypt are predominantly viewed as implementers of central policies rather than decision makers at the local level. The central government plays a significant role in decision-making and local service provision, controlling the majority of financial resources. This dominance is reflected in the central government's control over government revenues, thus limiting the role of local administration in spending on services. Empowering local administration serves as a key driver to improve the quality of public services provided to citizens and increase their satisfaction levels.

In this context, the state has worked on preparing a legal framework the “State's General Planning Law”, to empower local units to develop their developmental plans and sustainable development reports that identify developmental gaps. It also aims at granting local units greater freedom and flexibility in implementing these plans, while encouraging the mobilization of additional resources, and directing them towards developmental investment projects. Furthermore, the state aims through this legal framework, to promote participatory local decision-making by supporting the tasks of local councils. Additionally, the state seeks to expand local revenues, allowing local units to utilize them according to the priorities and requirements of local communities.

To ensure the achievement of SDGs, regular reports are prepared for each governorate to monitor the progress of specific targets and compare the achieved values of indicators with national averages. The purpose is to provide support and suggestions for improving areas that require attention or addressing challenges, thereby contributing to achieving inclusive and sustainable growth, and balanced regional development, hence emphasizing the principles of “leaving no one behind".

Developing the first “Competitiveness Index for Egyptian Governorates” aims to leverage the competitive advantage of local communities, fostering their growth through regional integration

and contributing to overall development. Simultaneously, the “Financing Formula” for governorates seeks fair and objective distribution of public investments among them, considering the distinct social and economic characteristics and conditions of each, while acknowledging a non-uniform set of benchmark criteria.

Therefore, Egypt's Vision 2030 strives to empower local administration by granting it greater decision-making authority and focusing on the comparative advantages of each governorate. This empowerment shall enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of local entities, while ensuring the existence of oversight and accountability systems.

## Means for Goal Attainment:
* Ensuring equitable allocation of investments – particularly those from the government – across diverse geographical regions.
* Adopting a gradual strategy that empowers local administration and enhances local human and institutional capacities.
* Improving infrastructure and information technology and establishing mechanisms for local accountability and oversight while amending local institutional frameworks.
* Reinforcing local complaint mechanisms.
* Empowering local administrations financially and establishing a system for intergovernmental fiscal transfers based on various indicators, such as population and poverty rates.
* Activating the role of governorates and localities in generating data on SDGs.

# 5. Strengthening Partnerships
Partnerships stand as a key gateway to achieving comprehensive and sustainable development. The responsibility of achieving goals extends beyond governments alone, including all development partners from the private sector, civil society, regional and international organizations, and youth initiatives. These partnerships are built on shared values, visions and objectives, leading to mutual benefits for all parties involved. By leveraging various forms of partnerships, be it financial, exchange of experiences, capacity-building, and/or participation in planning and implementation, the aim is to enhance collaboration in nation-building and shaping the future.

## Current Landscape:
The state prioritizes enhancing international, regional, and local partnerships as pivotal elements for achieving sustainable development by adopting various patterns of partnerships. Egypt seeks to maximize the benefits from different forms of bilateral and multilateral development cooperation. The ongoing development finance portfolio includes 377 projects valued at USD 25 billion. Development finance has been aligned with the SDGs to provide a comprehensive perspective on main financing trends consistent with the state's vision for achieving sustainable development and bridging the funding gap for goals implementation.

Egypt has witnessed an increase in the value of Official Development Assistance (ODA), reaching USD 10.27 billion in 2021, compared to USD 9.8 billion in 2020 and USD 8.6 billion in 2018. [76]

Net FDIs has shown variability in recent years, rising from USD 6.9 billion in 2015/16 to USD 7.4 billion in 2019/20, experiencing a minor decrease to USD 5.2 billion in 2020/21, followed by a renewed increase in 2021/22, reaching USD 8.9 billion. [77] The Egyptian government is keen on encouraging FDIs and places it among its priorities due to its positive impact on economic growth, job creation, technology transfer, and enhanced competitiveness.

The number of regional and international offices for international organizations operating in Egypt reached approximately 51 offices in 2019.[78] This reflects Egypt's interest in enhancing cooperation with these entities. This collaboration plays a crucial role in supporting integration and coordination in policy-making and implementation, providing technical support and best practices. The significance of this partnership model became evident during the COVID-19 crisis, that necessitated a high level of coordination between state entities and various international organizations operating in the country to address the various aspects of the crisis.

On the other hand, partnerships with the private sector are characterized by considerable flexibility and the ability to innovate, extending beyond corporate social responsibility initiatives to encompass impactful investments in various fields. In this context, the establishment of the Sovereign Fund of Egypt serves as a mechanism to enhance effective collaboration between the public and private sectors, leveraging untapped or underutilized government assets.

Partnerships with local and global civil society are highly significant, given their expertise and the trust they have earned within communities. Civil society's role extends beyond voluntary and charitable contributions. It is crucial in monitoring, raising awareness, and capacity-building. The number of organizations, institutions, and civil unions in Egypt had reached approximately 52,383 by 2020.[79] Over the years, civil society in Egypt played a notable role by addressing various issues, such as poverty reduction, hunger eradication, gender equality, economic empowerment, and environmental preservation. Notably, civil society in Egypt embarked on a new journey when the President of the Republic declared 2022 as the year of civil society and emphasized the need for collective efforts to achieve sustainable development.

Additionally, partnerships with youth initiatives have also been accorded more importance in the recent years. One notable example is Egypt's annual organization of the World Youth Forum since

2017, which serves as a significant platform for youth from around the world to exchange ideas, share experiences, and propose innovative policies that support decision-making processes.

Moreover, Egypt has been selected as the first model in the Middle East to launch the local version of the international initiative “Generation Unlimited-GenU” in 2022 which was launched during the UN General Assembly in 2018, known as “Shabab El-Balad (Country's Youth)”. The initiative is a partnership between the public sector, private sector, and youth; which adopts the concept of "learning to earning". It also aims at accelerating progress in the fields of education, employment, entrepreneurship, skills development, training and effective community participation of youth.

Egypt's Vision 2030 aims for collaboration between all development partners, to ensure concerted and consistent efforts and avoid duplication by adopting a participatory approach, in order to achieve sustainable development more efficiently and expeditiously.

## Means for Goal Attainment:
* Develop a national partnership database to facilitate data sharing among all stakeholders, ensuring consistency and synergy among efforts while avoiding duplication.
* Preparing an integrated development map for the financing needs through ODAs, as well as priority sectors and geographical regions.
* Conducting regular monitoring and evaluation of collaborations with regional and international development partners, to ensure the alignment of areas of cooperation with national priorities.
* Developing legislative frameworks governing partnerships among all stakeholders and establishing an incentive system to foster active cooperation.

# 6. Enhancing Regional and International Cooperation
Egypt's Vision 2030 aims for the state to adopt a participatory approach to address regional and international challenges, where Egypt's role is anchored in proposing new initiatives and ideas, as well as contributing to the consolidation of efforts towards achieving shared developmental interests for all.

## Current Landscape:
Throughout its ancient and modern history, Egypt has played an active role in its Arab, regional and international spheres due to its geographic location, historical significance, and its demographic characteristics. This role has taken various forms. There were instances when Egypt took the lead in generating fresh ideas and directions, be it in politics, economics, or modernization. In other instances, it supported just causes on the Arab, African, and international arenas. Moreover, Egypt sought to establish and foster economic and commercial relationships based on mutual interests.

In today's world, the regional and international landscape poses challenges that can only be addressed through collective action on a global scale. Accordingly, confronting global threats through multilateral cooperation is a fundamental pillar of Egypt's foreign policy. This includes a wide range of issues such as combating international terrorism and organized crime, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, promoting international trade cooperation and exploration and trade of energy, addressing climate change and environmental pollution, managing natural disasters, and effectively responding to pandemics like COVID-19.

Indeed, Egypt possesses several pillars that position it as a center for effective regional and international cooperation. These pillars include:

رؤية مصر
VISION OF EGYPT

• A national character deeply rooted in cultural history. This character draws upon the historical foundations of the Egyptian state, fostering unity among people and cultivating collective awareness of crucial issues.
• A melting pot of multiple and diverse civilizations and cultures throughout its history, fostering historical ties with cultures from various continents.
• A long-standing history of bilateral and multilateral international engagement, allowing Egypt to leverage this experience in serving sustainable development issues and finding common solutions to global challenges.
• Armed forces with high competence, readiness, and preparedness, contributing to maintaining regional peace and stability and supporting global efforts in maintaining international peace and security.
• A geographical location hosting one of the world's most vital international shipping passages, the Suez Canal. This integration into international trade networks positions Egypt as a vital element in international supply chains. Consequently, contributing to production and manufacturing processes which is closely intertwined with global growth rates.

## Means for Goal Attainment:
• Egypt places the issues of development and the well-being of nations at the center of international cooperation and partnerships, especially considering the geographical disparities in global development, which are significant causes of instability, both regionally and globally. Therefore, Egypt's Vision 2030 recognizes that development should be the ultimate objective of international cooperation, with each party contributing according to its level of economic development at any given time.

181
20/30
رؤية مصر
VISION OF EGYPT

• Committing to sustainable and peaceful solutions to resolve conflicts. This principle is deeply rooted in Egyptian history as a founding member of the United Nations (UN) and a country that has taken a leading role, for over four decades, in upholding the option of peace as the foundation for resolving the longstanding Arab-Israeli conflict, based on the principle of returning occupied territories in exchange for a peaceful settlement. Egypt believes that peaceful dispute resolution is the only fair and balanced approach to addressing regional and international conflicts, with the Palestinian issue being a central concern causing instability in the Middle East.
• Preserving the stability of national states and their institutions as a basis for economic development and progress, whether at the regional or international level. Ensuring security and peace for the people of a region and the world, as well as achieving significant strides in economic prosperity, are unattainable without maintaining national stability, while respecting the diversity and pluralism within each nation.
• Confronting and eliminating extremism and terrorism. Terrorist groups are the opposite of everything Egypt seeks to achieve like stability, progress, knowledge, modernization, and prosperity. Egypt aims to consolidate regional and international cooperation, whether in predicting terrorist threats, exchanging information about their dangers, or pursuing those involved.
• Committing to international resolutions and agreements signed between states and rejecting any attempt to impose a fait accompli while respecting international legitimacy. These include UN resolutions or agreements between states, whether this relates to the rights to divide international resources such as water, or the rights of self-determination. Egypt's Vision 2030 confirms that this is a permanent goal for its external role.
• Respecting the principle of national ownership of solutions. Past experiences have shown that each stage of development has its uniqueness, challenges, and specific solutions. The world has witnessed instances where countries faced difficulties due to importing ready-made solutions

to address problems that could have been better handled through national approaches. Egypt's Vision 2030 firmly believes in the right, and indeed the necessity, for each country to have its own developmental model.
• Egypt is committed to sharing its developmental experiences and human capabilities with its partners in Africa, Asia, and the global south that share a common pursuit of development. Egypt has a history of participating with Africa and other countries in the struggle for independence and in building national economies. Egypt seeks to further enhance this cooperation, benefiting all parties involved, and leveraging the successful development experiences of global south countries, stemming from the belief that all these countries have successful development experiences in specific sectors.
• Supporting mechanisms for joint Arab action, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to address the challenges facing the Arab world, including development issues, political and security crises, conflicts, terrorism, as well as organized crime. These efforts contribute positively to the security, stability, and well-being of the Arab region and its people.
• Reinforcing cooperation with African countries across all levels, considering it a fundamental aspect of Egypt's foreign policy. This can be achieved through, actively engaging in African blocs and groups to address economic and security matters in the continent, and leveraging the extensive capabilities and resources available in Africa for its comprehensive development.

# 7. Preserving Stability and Security

Egypt's Vision 2030 aims to establish stable and secure internal environment that facilitates the efficient mobilization and allocation of resources towards human, economic, and social development. The concept of stability, in this context, encompasses securing the necessary resources for the development process, with a primary focus on water and energy. This goal is vigorously pursued by controlling population growth, crucial for maintaining a balance between population and resources, a necessary equilibrium for sustaining stability.

## Current Landscape:
Egypt is positioned within a region that has faced challenges that threatened stable nation-states and affected its regional integrity and the security of its populations over the past decade. Terrorist organizations and extremist groups are on the top list of these threats. Egypt has witnessed periods of instability, notably in the 1980s and 1990s due to terrorist attacks. These instances have adversely impacted development indicators and economic growth rates, making it imperative to proactively confront these risks to provide the security and stability needed for directing resources toward investing in improving the quality of life.

Egypt's geographical location presents both challenges and opportunities regarding securing essential resources for the development process. As for water, which is crucial for sustaining life, 97% of Egypt's drinking water resources are dependent on external sources,[80] primarily the Nile River. As for energy, Egypt has made significant natural gas discoveries in the eastern Mediterranean, necessitating the protection of energy resources that extend hundreds of miles from its coastline.

Furthermore, Egypt has grappled with the issue of overpopulation for several decades. Failure to effectively address this problem could undermine any progress made in terms of development, thereby impacting stability and security. In the last 35 years alone, Egypt's population has more than doubled, increasing from 48 million in 1986 to 101 million in 2020.[81] This steady population growth may have negative repercussions on stability, as it leads to resource competition and generates a sense of relative deprivation, even with high growth rates.

## Means for Goal Attainment:
### First: Securing essential resources for life and development requirements
• Water Security: Egypt is working on two tracks to achieve water security:
- Preserving existing water resources and improving their utilization efficiency by adhering to international agreements to secure Egypt's allocated share of the Nile River waters. Egypt also seeks to enhance the cooperation with Nile Basin countries to reduce losses in the river's flow to serve the mutual interests of these countries. The Vision also aims at raising awareness and promoting the culture of water conservation.
- Strengthening the current water resources with new resources to bridge the gap between local production and actual needs. This involves investing in desalination of sea water and implementing the re-use strategies as per the scientific and environmental standards.
• Energy Security: Egypt seeks to:
- Increase reliance on renewable energy sources, targeting a 42% contribution to electricity production by 2035 in accordance with the 7th SDG.

- Simultaneously, the Vision strives to reinforce its energy resources derived from fossil fuels. This will be achieved through intensified exploration and production of oil and gas, while ensuring the security of the fields located within Egypt's political and maritime boundaries.

- Egypt envisions becoming a regional hub for trading renewable and nonrenewable energy, fostering broader partnerships for discoveries in the region, and facilitating cross-border energy transactions through commercial agreements. The signing of the East Mediterranean Gas Forum charter in September 2020, which establishes a regional and international organization and a platform for structured political dialogue on natural gas, constitutes a milestone in this field. It contributes to developing a sustainable regional gas market that can unlock the potential of gas resources in the eastern Mediterranean region.

- Cybersecurity and information security: The Vision aims to enhance Egypt's capabilities in information security and fortify its ability to counter cyberattacks. This involves strategic investments in well-trained human resources and efficient information infrastructure.

# Second: Confronting Threats to the Security and Safety of Egyptians

- Combatting Terrorism: Terrorism poses the most serious threat to societal security and development, violating the fundamental human right to life. Unlike ordinary criminals who act out of self-interest, terrorists -whether individuals or organizations- are driven by distorted beliefs and ideologies. To effectively combat terrorism, Egypt's Vision 2030 focuses on three pathways:
    - Strengthening national efforts to anticipate terrorist threats by intensifying information gathering, launching proactive operations, detecting terrorist activities, and pursuing the perpetrators, all while adhering to relevant legal procedures.
    - Intellectually combating extremist rhetoric through a revitalized religious discourse, raising awareness to counter extremist ideologies, and incorporating values of tolerance and acceptance of others into educational curricula.

- Pursuing a path of development, as any advancements made towards the development goals outlined in the Vision directly bolster the growth of a society committed to safeguarding its developmental achievements and possessing the necessary human and economic resources to tackle extremist organizations and can effectively discern between misleading ideologies and enlightening initiatives.

• Combating Organized Crime, Illegal Migration, and Criminal Activities:

Egypt is waging this confrontation by working on two levels:

- Internally: The National Strategy on Combating Illegal Migration (2016-2026) is a framework for efforts in this regard. It aims at raising public awareness of the dangers of illegal immigration and human trafficking, in addition to mobilizing necessary resources to enhance efforts dealing with this issue, as well as support development as a basis for combating it. Moreover, the strategy focuses on building the technical, technological, and human capabilities of the agencies responsible for detecting these crimes and prosecuting the perpetrators, in coordination with the civil police and the armed forces to secure the borders.

- Externally: Regional and international coordination and cooperation with neighboring countries to secure borders, develop joint training operations, and maximize the benefits from the experiences and programs applied in the corresponding security agencies.
