# Assistant Director General (ADG) Foreword
We have officially entered the Age of Artificial Intelligence. The world is now set to change at a pace not seen in decades, even centuries. Al-based tools and applications make our lives easier, smoother, and richer. They help us move efficiently, get informed, get credit, get a job, and get our taxes done.

But in its current form, Al reproduces and amplifies many of the social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that around a third of the world's population still lacks adequate internet access. Upstream, the Al industry is highly concentrated, with just two countries – the United States and China - and a dozen companies accounting for a major share of the sector. This can lead only to greater inequality of outcomes – including gender disparities – downstream. Non-diverse Al teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque and biased algorithms can cause harm, particularly to those who are already vulnerable, whether companies or individuals, children and young people, women, or entire democracies.

That is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was adopted in 2021 by 193 countries to make sure Al delivers fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes.

5

---

The Recommendation is based on the protection and promotion of human rights, human dignity, and environmental sustainability, and these values are then translated into principles such as accountability, transparency, and privacy. The Recommendation also sets out concrete policy actions that governments can draw on to steer technological developments in a responsible direction, premised on the belief that light-touch regulation, which has until now remained the norm, is insufficient. We need capable governments that are well equipped, in terms of competencies, institutions and laws, to frame responsible Al development and protect the rule of law online, and public and private developers who are accountable for putting human rights and fundamental freedoms - not profits or geopolitical considerations – first.

The Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) is a diagnostic tool intended to assist Member States in upholding their commitment to the Recommendation by helping them understand how prepared they are to implement Al ethically and responsibly for all their citizens. By highlighting any institutional, regulatory, or data gaps and obstacles, it enables UNESCO to tailor support for governments to fill those gaps to ensure an ethical Al ecosystem aligned with the Recommendation.

In the Kingdom of Bahrain, the RAM exercise highlights both significant achievements and areas requiring further development. The country has taken important steps to establish a foundation for responsible Al, including ongoing work on a National Al Strategy and participation in regional efforts such as the GCC's Al Ethical Guidelines.

The assessment also notes Bahrain's rapid rise in the UN E-Government Development Index and its Tier 1 ranking in the ITU Global Cybersecurity Index, reflecting the Kingdom's commitment to digital transformation and secure innovation. At the same time, challenges remain—particularly in strengthening coordination across government entities, accelerating the implementation of the national data sharing framework, and investing in advanced Al research and specialized skills.

Based on the RAM findings, the report recommends consolidating these achievements by embedding Al ethics more deeply into national practice, expanding capacity-building programs to develop a skilled workforce, and enhancing mechanisms for transparency, accountability, and public engagement. By advancing these priorities while leveraging its ongoing policy initiatives, Bahrain is well-positioned to become a regional leader in responsible and human-centered Al development.

Overall, this report presents a fundamentally optimistic vision that we at UNESCO share: that ethical governance and responsible regulation of Al is entirely consistent with innovation and economic growth and is essential for ensuring a technological ecosystem that benefits the public good. With the RAM data and this report, Kingdom of Bahrain has a clear roadmap for how to get there.

It was a pleasure working with the Government of Bahrain to conduct this exercise. We are grateful for their engagement with the RAM, and I am sure that by following the path laid out in this report, Kingdom of Bahrain will be able to reap the benefits of Al while making sure that Al technologies deliver fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes.

# AI POLICY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS

Under the directives of His Excellency General Shaikh Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa, Minister of Interior and Chairman of the Ministerial Committee for Information Technology and Communication (MCICT), the iGA launched the National Policy for the Use of Artificial Intelligence in July 2025. This policy establishes a comprehensive framework to regulate Al use in Bahrain, ensuring alignment with national priorities and maximizing benefits across society and the economy.

The policy aims to promote responsible and secure use of Al to drive economic and social growth while enhancing government efficiency across key sectors. It supports Bahrain's Economic Vision 2030 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, aligning with both national regulations (such as the Personal Data Protection Law, the Protection of Information and State Documents Law, and the Open Data Policy) and international standards.

The National Al Policy is built around four key pillars:

1.  Legal compliance
2.  Al use and adoption
3.  Public education and awareness
4.  Enhancing local and international cooperation

It is intended for a broad audience, including government officials, decision-makers, legislators, academics, researchers, private sector actors, and citizens engaging with smart services. By creating a clear framework, the policy seeks to unify and regulate Al initiatives and investments, boost performance, streamline procedures, and strengthen public trust in Al-driven services (IGA, 2025).

To reinforce these national efforts, Bahrain has also adopted the Guiding Manual on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence Use in the GCC, issued by the GCC Ministerial Committee for eGovernment. This manual complements the National Al Policy by providing a shared regional reference point for the responsible use of Al. It emphasizes that Al systems deployed across the Gulf must respect human dignity, Islamic values, and the cultural identity of GCC societies, while also advancing sustainability, cooperation, and social well-being.

The manual outlines principles such as preserving human autonomy, ensuring safety and reliability, preventing discrimination, and protecting privacy and data security. By embedding these ethical considerations into Al adoption, the GCC framework ensures that innovation does not come at the expense of social cohesion or trust. For Bahrain, aligning with this regional manual strengthens its

Alongside the forms, two surveys were distributed to assess the overall Al readiness of both internal and external entities.

The surveys focused on key areas such as Al infrastructure, policy development, training needs, and ethical considerations. The challenge here was to ensure that the survey questions were clear and relevant to each respondent's role and expertise, as there was a considerable variation in understanding Al across the different participants. Additionally, there was a need to analyze and synthesize responses from both iGA and external stakeholders, which was time-consuming due to the volume of data and the complexity of different answers.

# Contributions of Stakeholders and Development of the Report
With the data from the forms and surveys in hand, the next step was to analyze the findings and incorporate them into the development of the Al roadmap. This stage of the process revealed a key challenge: balancing the diverse perspectives and expectations of different stakeholders. For instance, while iGA's focus was on the national infrastructure and regulatory frameworks, external entities had more sector-specific concerns, such as the need for Al-driven public service delivery or data governance policies.

Nevertheless, each contribution was crucial in shaping a well-rounded roadmap that reflected both Bahrain's long-term goals and the immediate needs of its diverse government entities. The final report, which was developed based on the data collected and further research, encapsulated these findings and provided a comprehensive framework for Bahrain's Al future.

# Building the Al Roadmap: A Collective Effort
The final Al roadmap represented a collective effort of all stakeholders involved in the process. It drew on insights from both internal and external entities, addressing the challenges faced by various sectors and providing clear guidelines for how Bahrain can move forward in its Al journey. The report was built not only from data analysis but also from the ongoing collaboration between ministries, agencies, and iGA.

In conclusion, while the engagement process was marked by significant challenges-especially as iGA participated for the first time and many external entities faced similar hurdles—the collaborative nature of the project enabled Bahrain to build a robust Al strategy. The process demonstrated the power of stakeholder involvement and paved the way for Bahrain to harness Al in a sustainable, ethical, and impactful manner.

# Key Insights: Challenges and Opportunities in Stakeholder-Driven Al Strategy Development
The development of Bahrain's Al roadmap, driven by wide-ranging stakeholder involvement, offered a wealth of insights into the nation's readiness for Al adoption. This multi-layered process, although promising, also came with its share of complexities. As this was the first time the Information and eGovernment Authority (iGA) led a project of this kind, and the first instance of national-level Al engagement for many of the external government entities, the journey was one of learning, capacity-building, and adaptation.

Below is a consolidated overview of the core challenges and corresponding opportunities that arose throughout the roadmap creation process:

## Institutional Readiness vs. Strategic Potential
**Challenge:** Many entities, especially within iGA, were engaging with Al strategy for the first time. There was knowledge gaps related to Al's technical, ethical, and governance dimensions. This slowed initial momentum, especially in interpreting what was required for meaningful contribution.

**Opportunity:** This created a foundation for institutional learning. It catalyzed internal conversations about digital maturity and helped position iGA as a central coordinator of Al governance role it is now more prepared to build upon.

## Multi-Stakeholder Coordination vs. Cross-Sector Engagement
**Challenge:** Coordinating nearly 50 external government entities, each with different levels of digital maturity, sector-specific goals, and operational capacity, was logistically and administratively demanding. Some entities lacked a clear understanding of Al's relevance to their sector.

**Opportunity:** This same diversity became an asset. It allowed for a rich exchange of insights across sectors like healthcare, education, transportation, and public safety. The process helped break silos and promoted a whole-of-government approach to Al.

## Technical Literacy vs. Capacity Building
**Challenge:** Limited Al awareness and literacy among many stakeholders resulted in inconsistent data submissions, delays in form completion, and the need for ongoing clarification.

54

**Opportunity:** These gaps highlighted the urgent need for targeted capacity-building programs, which can now be addressed in follow-up actions of the roadmap. It also created space for designing future training initiatives tailored to the specific needs of different ministries and agencies.

## Customization Complexity vs. Data Relevance
**Challenge:** Developing customized data collection forms for both iGA and each external entity required significant time and effort, especially to ensure contextual relevance and clarity.

**Opportunity:** This customization process yielded sector-specific insights that are far more actionable than generic surveys. The tailored forms improved data relevance and allowed the final report to reflect each sector's unique Al potential and barriers.

# IX. Framing Bahrain's Al Future: Strategic Priorities and Actionable Guidance

✓ Develop a National Al Data Infrastructure & Framework
Establish a centralized and comprehensive data collection, management, and governance framework to support Al development and continuous monitoring. This framework will be implemented through the National Data Sharing Framework, which acts as the core governance mechanism for Bahrain's National Data Sharing Platform. It will define the policies, standards, and processes that ensure interoperability, security, and data quality across academic, governmental, and private sector sources. By providing a structured and trusted foundation, the framework will enable evidence-based policymaking, foster innovation, and strengthen public trust in data-driven initiatives.

✓ Finalize and Adopt the National Al Strategy
Endorse and implement a comprehensive National Al Strategy that articulates Bahrain's long-term vision for artificial intelligence. The strategy will define clear pillars, measurable objectives, and a phased implementation roadmap, ensuring coordinated national efforts that drive innovation, strengthen competitiveness, and deliver sustainable economic and social impact.

✓ Strengthen Inclusive STEM Education
Bolster national efforts to advance STEM education, with a specific focus on equity and inclusion. Initiatives should target underrepresented groups: especially women, youth from rural areas, and people with disabilities through scholarships, mentorship programs, and partnerships with community organizations.

✓ Launch a National Al Awareness Campaign
Design and roll out innovative public engagement campaigns that demystify Al and foster critical dialogue. These should use accessible platforms such as social media, TV, podcasts, and community events to raise awareness of Al's societal and environmental implications and empower citizens with digital literacy skills.

✓ Facilitate Cross-sectoral and Interdisciplinary Collaboration
Promote a collaborative ecosystem that bridges gaps between engineers, ethicists, policymakers, social scientists, and environmental experts. This will encourage holistic approaches to Al that consider not only technical feasibility but also long-term societal outcomes.

✓ Promote Al Entrepreneurship and Innovation
Position Bahrain as a regional hub for Al startups and private-sector investment, encouraging innovation and commercialization of Al solutions.

✓ Invest in Purpose-driven Ethical Al Research
Provide sustained funding for Al research that emphasizes ethical, societal, and ecological impacts. Research should address themes such as bias in algorithms, the societal impact of automation, and climate-related risks of Al technologies, aligning innovation with long-term human and environmental welfare.
