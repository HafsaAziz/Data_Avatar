# Foreword

The Government of Egypt (GoE) has enacted major reforms and strategies to improve its public governance and foster inclusive and sustainable economic growth. In particular, the GoE launched the "Sustainable Development Strategy: Egypt Vision 2030” (SDS) to attain its key strategic development objectives by 2030 and pursue the United Nations 2030 Agenda. To achieve this, the GoE has adapted its institutional landscape, tailoring different agencies and institutes to be fit-for-purpose and building analytical, research and implementation capacities to reach these goals.

This Review focuses on the role of the National Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (NIGSD), previously known as the National Management Institute, in achieving Egypt's sustainable development and public governance objectives. Since 2020, the NIGSD has evolved into a public economic organisation with advisory, training and research functions, working at the intersection of good governance, competitiveness and sustainable development. In this context, the GoE has partnered with the OECD to enhance the NIGSD's internal governance structures and practices, as well as advise on the expertise and tools that the NIGSD could use to mainstream better governance practices and build capacities for sustainable development across the public administration.

The Review consists of a thorough analysis of the NIGSD that has two main goals:

*   Improve the internal governance of the NIGSD to strengthen its capacity to fulfil its new mandate effectively. The Review assesses internal governance practices and provides recommendations to strengthen transparency, public integrity, co-ordination, accountability, budget autonomy, effective and transparent communications, and effective use of resources to achieve greater impact.
*   Improve service provision to its client organisations by building capacity to focus its client and project selection on areas of governance and sustainable development that reflect the institute's mandate and strategic objectives. The Review analyses partnerships between the NIGSD and client organisations and offers recommendations to expand domestic and international stakeholder relationships in areas of strategic importance.

The Review also shares best practices from institutes in OECD countries working on governance and sustainable development to improve both its internal governance and service delivery to client organisations, particularly from the KDZ Centre for Public Administration Research, CIFAL Flanders, the Institute for Research on Public Policy in Canada, the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations in France, and the National Institute of Public Administration in Spain.

The Review is part of the Governance and Anti-corruption Pillar 3 from the OECD Egypt Country Programme. It constitutes a key priority of the MENA-OECD Governance Programme in the Programme of Work 2023-2024 of the OECD Public Governance Committee. This work is pursued in complementarity with the EU-funded project "Support to Enhanced Administrative and Public Economic Governance in Egypt" to incentivise and support ongoing structural reforms. The Review draws upon the evidence and good practices gathered by the OECD Public Governance Committee, the working groups and networks of the MENA-OECD Governance Programme, and OECD Recommendations.

# Executive summary

The National Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (NIGSD) is a unique and pivotal institution in Egypt and the MENA region with its mandate that integrates governance, sustainable development, and competitiveness, as well as its distinctive para-public structure and service provision. These attributes enable the NIGSD to support a wide range of governmental and non-governmental clients and position it as the only such institute in the region addressing these interconnected topics in a comprehensive manner. To fulfil these objectives, the National Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development has expanded its competences and activities to perform training, research and advisory services for a large number of academic, public and private partners in Egypt and internationally. This expansion followed a major transformation in September 2020 to better connect the Institute with Egypt's Vision 2030 and SDG agenda. The NIGSD has become recognised as a key player in Egypt's public sector and civil society, demonstrating a strong commitment to excellence through an extended focus on good government practices and affiliations with many national and international actors. With its mandate and activities expanding, the NIGSD must address a number of challenges to embrace this transformation and support such an ambitious agenda, such as covering new policy issues and targets while maintaining quality, working with a growing number of partners, and sustaining its financial and resource model over the long term.

This Review provides a comprehensive analysis of Egypt's NIGSD with the aim of enhancing its capacity and impact to foster better governance for sustainable development across the public administration. As an autonomous public economic organisation under the Ministry of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation (MPEDIC), the NIGSD's strategic position within the Egyptian government makes it ideally suited to build and disseminate knowledge and skills, offer guidance, and provide technical support to ministries and other public and private entities in developing effective and accountable governance for sustainable development across the public administration and society.

## Key findings and suggested directions of work
The NIGSD has established a strong reputation for expertise in good governance and sustainable development, both within Egypt's public administration and internationally. The relevance and quality of its work is widely acknowledged by partners and clients. Its ability to cover a broad spectrum of policy issues and activities stems not only from its dynamism and leadership but also from its strategic collaborations with key players from the public and private sectors and from academia in Egypt and internationally, the diversity of its expertise, and its responsiveness to the evolving needs of clients. These factors have enabled the NIGSD to continuously expand into new fields of work and develop innovative solutions to meet demands.

The Institute has progressively reinforced its strategic position and vision, including through a widely communicated mission statement. Given these developments, the mandate of the NIGSD could be further updated to more formally clarify its responsibilities to all partners, and the NIGSD could complement it with a more detailed strategic document. This could also help the NIGSD better align its resources with its

expanding activities, prioritise some activities -- particularly research and analysis -- and enhance its impact on Egypt's governance and sustainable development objectives. For instance, dedicating more resources and capacities to competitiveness could help raise the profile of the NIGSD on this issue.

The NIGSD exhibits a well-defined internal operational and leadership structure, which is evolving quickly, with an independent Board of Trustees and a close relation with the MPEDIC. The Institute has been developing its research, consultancy and training capacities, which could bolster the MPEDIC's co-ordination and monitoring efforts in good governance for sustainable development. Efforts to strengthen the partnership with the MPEDIC through formal and informal work relations should be pursued to maximise NIGSD's relevance and value added to MPEDIC activities. Anchoring its role in cross-government co-ordination with the MPEDIC, while investing in new training and research capabilities, would further enhance its operations and impact, particularly in supporting the MPEDIC's work and analysis for achieving Egypt Vision 2030. This must be balanced with the need for the NIGSD to maintain and strengthen its budget and institutional autonomy through non-government funded activities.

The NIGSD has established a strong network of prestigious domestic and international partners, contributing significantly to the Institute's work and reputation as a reference on governance issues. While these partnerships vary in scope and duration, a more formalised partnership strategy could optimise their long-term impact and contribution to the NIGSD's activities. By further targeting partnerships, guided by a strategic document with clear objectives, expectations, and rules of engagement, the NIGSD can ensure more structured contribution to its overall strategic objectives.

The NIGSD has significantly enhanced its communication capabilities, reaching out to the general public and current and potential partners and clients through traditional press releases and social media platforms. To ensure more effective and inclusive communication efforts, the Institute could develop a comprehensive and integrated communication strategy outlining clear objectives, target audiences, priorities and channels, particularly to support communications efforts to the youth population and through social media.

The NIGSD has developed and used several public governance tools focused on governance, sustainable development and competitiveness, particularly on topics such as anticorruption, SDGs, women and youth empowerment and good governance. Its approach to the development of tools has been significantly driven by specific government and partner requests. The NIGSD could continue to expand its toolkit on more focused working areas, such as strengthening civil service skills, promoting public integrity, or enhancing citizen and stakeholder participation and disseminate them widely within Egypt's public administration.

# 1 Navigating the Egyptian landscape for good governance and sustainable development

This chapter explores the challenges and advancements in Egypt's journey towards sustainable development and good governance, underpinned by Egypt Vision 2030. It discusses Egypt's demographic and fiscal pressures, and the trajectory of reforms to governance and public administration. The chapter highlights the NIGSD's role in fostering efficiency, accountability and competitiveness within a complex institutional landscape and Egypt's ongoing commitment to the SDGs.

## A challenging context for promoting and supporting the development of good governance for sustainable development

The NIGSD operates in a challenging context for promoting and supporting the development of effective governance to achieve sustainable development. Egypt has set ambitious development goals and agenda through Egypt Vision 2030. The strategy recognises the importance of a modern and efficient public administration to fulfil its goals. In that regard, several challenges prevail in Egypt's public administration for advancing at the planned path towards sustainable development such as the low effectiveness and large size of the public sector, the uneven awareness of sustainable development across the administration, and limited fiscal capacity in a context of competing goals and priorities. The dynamic demographics of Egypt also add to these challenges in terms of ensuring the access and quality of public services, measures, and policies to a large population.

## Supporting Egypt's progress towards reaching the Sustainable Development Goals
Egypt Vision 2030 has developed a vision for Egypt that aims to guide SDG efforts in the country:

The Vision aspires for Egypt, by 2030, to evolve into a competitive, well-balanced, and diversified economy, anchored in innovation and knowledge, and grounded in justice, social inclusion, and participation, with a balanced and diversified ecosystem to achieve sustainable development and improve the quality of life of Egyptians, without compromising the rights of future generations.

Egypt has advanced in a number of crucial development areas including reducing poverty, granting access to key infrastructure and utilities and enhancing education, that can help contribute to reaching the sustainable development goals. For instance, the share of population living in extreme poverty decreased from 6.2% in 2017-2018 to 4.5% in 2019-2020 according to a Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics (CAPMAS) study (State Information Service, 2021[1]), and has been further decreasing to 2.5% in 2023 according to the Sustainable Development Report data (Sachs, J.D., Lafortune, G., Fuller, G., Drumm, E., 2023[2]). As of 2023, close to 50% of the SDGs were achieved or on track for completion. However, the country ranks only 81th in the 2023 Sustainable Development Report, and significant efforts are still needed to reach the SDGs by 2030, including on SDG 17 that relates to Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (Sachs, J.D., Lafortune, G., Fuller, G., Drumm, E., 2023[2]).

Additionally, the country's high population growth rate represents an additional challenge for the country's development and for reaching its planned sustainable goals. In 2023, Egypt's population amounted to around 113 million (United Nations Population Fund, 2023 [3]) and according to current projections is expected to double by 2080. In the last five years, the population has grown every year by 1.7% on average (OECD, 2024[4]). This outlook represents a major challenge to the State's development efforts, as a higher population will likely result in a larger labour force participation contributing positively to the development of the country but can pose a serious challenge to achieving sustainable development goals.

## Fostering good governance and the fiscal space to support sustainable development
While Egypt has put in place an institutional framework and implemented the Public Administration Reform Plan (PARP) to improve its public administration and achieve its planned policy outputs, particularly the realisation of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, specific challenges persist in its effective implementation across the public administration hindering the achievement of strategies such as Egypt Vision 2030. The Reform Plan lacks critical elements to provide a clear transformation strategy of the public administration such as the absence of data, evidence and quantitative/qualitative targets supporting objectives, and the lack of an action plan acting as a roadmap for attaining the planned objectives, including roles and responsibilities for all actors, starting with the NIGSD (OECD, Forthcoming [5]).

fundamentally, the agenda on public governance reform should be more closely linked to Egypt's broader ambitions on sustainable development.

Fostering good governance and the efficiency of the public administration are crucial to NIGSD's agenda and to reaching the objectives of Egypt Vision 2030. Egypt's public sector is acknowledged for its considerable size and offers opportunities for enhancing effectiveness. Egypt scores 35.58 on government effectiveness in the Worldwide Governance Indicators, compared to the MENA region scoring 42.35 on average (World Bank, 2021 [6]). Public sector employment represented an estimated 22% of total employment in 2019, while this fraction amounted to 18.6% on average across OECD countries in 2021, reflecting a higher prevalence of jobs driven by the public sector in Egypt than in OECD countries (World Bank, 2016[7]; OECD, 2023[8]). In addition, trends reveal that Egyptian women are more present in the public sector than in the private sector. While optimising the number of civil servants has been recognised as a key reform priority by successive governments, the large size of the public sector in the labour market has led to complex processes, creating burdens and inefficiencies for both the public and private sectors as well as for citizens. This has also led to additional pressures on public finances, particularly in the current poly-crisis context (OECD, Forthcoming[5]).

Similarly, Egypt's financial capacity to mobilise resources and address sustainable development goals has been increasingly challenged as Egypt's fiscal space has tightened in the last few years. Public debt relative to GDP has risen in the last years with high levels of public deficit. Since 2019, public debt as a percentage of GDP has risen from 80% to 88% in 2022 and is forecasted to reach 93% in 2023 mainly to deal with the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. Simultaneously, the public deficit has been high in recent years amounting to 6% of GDP in 2022. Nonetheless, both fractions are forecasted to improve in the coming years (IMF, 2023[9]). A plausible rise in public expenditure to mitigate the negative impacts of the war, particularly high inflation, might pose additional concerns for fiscal sustainability and represent a challenge for implementing the SDS (OECD, 2023[8]).

## Enhancing competitiveness to support economic growth and sustainable development
Enhancing competitiveness is a crucial challenge for Egypt's economic development that can help increase investment, boost economic growth, create jobs and economic opportunities, and ultimately improve the lives of citizens. Boosting competitiveness is identified as a key objective in Egypt Vision 2030 (Egypt's Ministry of Economic Development and Planning, 2023 [10]) (OECD, 2024[4]). Egypt has notably improved in the Global Competitiveness Index since the first edition of the Index in 2016, ranking 93rd in 2020 compared to 115th in 2016, with key strengths identified in infrastructure and market size (World Economic Forum, 2020[11]). The capacity to attract Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) and the complexity and diversification of the economy are among the key drivers for enhancing competitiveness. Egypt has carried out a number of important reforms to support FDI attraction and diversification, through amendments of the Investment Law, new incentives for investors and developing zone-based policies and public-private partnerships (OECD, 2024[4]) (OECD, 2020[12]). FDIs flows to Egypt have been significantly increasing since 2011 and have doubled to USD 11bn in 2022 compared to 2021, surpassing pre-crisis levels (UNCTAD, 2023[13]). Egypt's ranking in the Economic Complexity Index has remained stable over the past year and stands at 67th out of 144 countries in 2021 (Harvard Growth' Lab, 2023[14]). The country can further improve its competitiveness particularly in areas related to institutions and competition, digitalisation, labour market and innovation (OECD, 2020[12]) (World Economic Forum, 2020[11]) (Egypt's Ministry of Economic Development and Planning, 2023[10]).

(MPEDIC), the Central Agency for Administration and Organisation (CAOA), Sustainable Development
Units in ministries, SDG focal points in ministries, Strategic Management Units (SMUs) in ministries,
Governance and Internal Audit Units in ministries and key strategies and reform plans such as the Egypt
Vision 2030, the PARP, and the anti-corruption strategy 2023 - 2030. Within this context, the NIGSD aims
to disseminate knowledge/skills and provide advice to develop effective and accountable systems of
governance for sustainable development – the institute's mandate, roles, activities, and structure will be
analysed with detail in the next chapter.

The institute is a unique public economic organisation in the Egyptian institutional landscape on
sustainable development and public governance, with a mandate seeking to enhance Egypt's progress
and performance with respect to governance, sustainable development, and competitiveness. It is
headquartered in Cairo and operates under the supervision of the Minister of Planning, Economic
Development and International Cooperation (MPEDIC) and governed by a Board of trustees, headed by
the Minister (NIGSD, 2020[15]). It is the only institute for governance and sustainable development in the
MENA region, and its uniqueness stems from its structure and service provision, i.e., a public economic
organisation with a para-public management structure, as well as governmental and non-governmental
external clients, as well as from its combination of interconnected topics around governance,
competitiveness, and sustainable development (while other organisations might address those issues
separately). The NIGSD stands at a crucial intersection where it can lend support to various organisations
in different ways. It collaborates with MPEDIC regarding the Sustainable Development Strategy, CAOA on
matters of public governance, and works alongside the public governance units within line Ministries.
Additionally, it plays a role in supporting different agencies and institutes, such as the Administrative
Control Authority (ACA), particularly in addressing public integrity and anti-corruption issues.

MPEDIC supports and coordinates with NIGSD operations and its Minister chairs the Board of Trustee,
thus providing strategic guidance. The Ministry plays a leading role in policymaking, achieving the SDGs
and long-term planning, designing evidence-informed policies via effective planning, monitoring and
evaluation, alongside managing public investments towards a knowledge-based and competitive economy
in partnership with the private sector and civil society. Inter alia, MPEDIC develops long, medium and
short-term sustainable development plans and ensures consistency of the implementation of sectoral
strategies and plans with the development strategy and the budget; implements and monitors public
policies; proposes policies to improve the competitiveness of the economy; and proposes draft laws and
decrees to enhance economic development (MPED, 2023[16]).

MPEDIC has also formulated and monitors the implementation of the Egypt Vision 2030 in co-ordination
with line ministries and stakeholders. The Vision was launched in 2016 to promote sustainable
development and enact a specific set of public policies to reach concrete climate, social and economic
goals by 2030. It is the first Egypt's strategy of this kind and acts as the governing framework for all
development programmes and projects that are to be pursued through 2030. MPEDIC is the institution at
the centre of government (CoG) mandated to steer and coordinate the implementation of the Egypt Vision
2030 using a whole-of-government approach and leads the strategy updates as well. Since 2016, the SDS
has been through an updating process that was recently finalised in order to integrate growing socio-
economic challenges such as climate change (e.g., growing water scarcity), high population growth and
rising inflation (see Box 1.1) (OECD, Forthcoming[17]). In addition, MPEDIC also monitors the
implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and ensures compliance with the
2063 African Agenda (MPED, 2023[16]).

## Box 1.1. The updated Egypt Vision 2030

The updating process was based on a participatory approach led by a task force that brought together
all relevant stakeholders and actors led by government entities, representatives from the private sector
and civil society, and a group of experts and academics from various disciplines. This task force
identified a set of key factors crucial to the updating process by monitoring the current situation
regarding the implementation of the Vision. These factors include the need to emphasize the
interdependence of the dimensions of sustainable development (i.e., economic, social, and
environmental); improve monitoring practices; concentrate on several pressing matters that the State
has identified as having the utmost strategic significance (i.e., population growth, climate change, water
scarcity etc.); improve response speed tackling emerging global challenges; and emphasize the
significance of the Vision's versatility and adaptability.

As a result, the updated version of Egypt's Vision 2030 presents:

*   **Four guiding principles:** Putting the Citizen at the Core and Centre of Development;
    Guaranteeing Equity and Accessibility for All; Improving Resilience and Adaptation; and
    Strengthening Sustainability.
*   **Seven enablers for attaining sustainable development and achieving the goals by
    2030:** financing, technology and innovation, digital transformation, data availability,
    legislative environment, supportive cultural values, and population growth management.
*   **Six strategic objectives:** improving Egyptians' quality of life and raising their living
    standards; achieving social justice and equality; reaching an integrated and sustainable
    environmental system; promoting a competitive and diversified knowledge economy;
    strengthening a well-developed infrastructure; and enhancing governance and partnerships.
*   **Thirty-two complementary and interdependent sector-based goals** to achieve the six
    strategic sustainable development objectives in Egypt.

Source: (OECD, Forthcoming[17]).

Additionally, Sustainable Development Units and SDG focal points or strategic management units (SMUs)
in line ministries play a relevant role in the institutional landscape of sustainable development in Egypt.
These units and focal points have been set-up in ministries to enhance inter-institutional co-ordination and
are designed to serve as key contacts for raising awareness on SDGs, ensuring that sustainable
development strategies within their own entities are aligned with the Egypt Vision 2030 and to facilitate the
co-ordination and monitoring process led by MPEDIC. However, at the time of drafting this review they
have not been yet streamlined and are not uniformly integrated into the structures of all ministries, with
only 4 ministries having established them (MPEDIC - for both its planning and international cooperation
functions, the Ministry of Tourism, the Ministry of Education and Technical Education, and the Ministry of
Environment), which can make the work and co-ordination on reaching SDGs across the public
administration more challenging (OECD, Forthcoming[17]). MPEDIC also seeks to push the boundaries of
international cooperation with multilateral and bilateral development partners, governments, the private
sector and civil society, to support the national development agenda in line with the SDGs (MPEDIC,
2024[18]). MPEDIC also plays a key role in monitoring ODA-financed projects and ensuring alignment with
the SDGs through a systematic monitoring process, through its ODA-SDG mapping exercise and the
implementation of the Framework for International Cooperation & Development Financing. This Framework
focuses on maximizing socio-economic returns from ODA and aligning development interventions with
national and SDG objectives in Egypt.

Lastly, these whole-of-government long-term strategies cannot be reached without a fit-for-purpose public
administration that has the capacities to deliver public policies, services and outcomes for citizens.
Thereby, CAOA plays a key role as well in advancing towards sustainable development, as it is the leading
institution in charge of public administration reform and training. CAOA has been responsible for civil
service management and public administration reform. Currently, the Agency leads three broad work
areas: implementation and supervision of the PARP; public employment; and the reallocation to the New
Capital from a civil service perspective. It develops, reviews, and supports the implementation of the PARP
by all line ministries through its different units with expertise on the pillars of the PARP. The main objective
of the PARP is to build "an efficient, effective, competent, transparent, fair and responsive governmental
administrative body that provides high-quality services, maintains accountability, increases citizens'
satisfaction, and contributes significantly to the realisation of the national development goals and
improvement of the country status” (Egypt's Ministry of Planning, Monitoring and Administrative Reform,
2017[19]) (see Box 1.2) (OECD, Forthcoming[5]). While the objective clearly links public administration
reform and sustainable development, the PARP has not fully reached its objectives and its ultimate
contributions to sustainable development goals remain to be assessed. Through its activities, the NIGSD
has already been active in supporting the implementation of several of the objectives of the PARP on public
administration effectiveness and on competencies and capacity building for civil servants.

The Public Governance Review of Egypt (PGR) (OECD, 2024[20]), conducted within the framework of an
EU-funded project, focuses to a considerable extent on relations across the government on strategic
planning and public administration initiatives, and the roles played by MPEDIC, CAOA and the NIGSD,
and argues in favour of a more systematic, formal cooperation and co-ordination between these three
institutions on matters of mutual concern relating to the implementation of Egypt Vision 2030. Indeed, the
PGR recommends the codification of this inter-institutional cooperation using such tools as a formal
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that would outline roles, responsibilities, and deliverables in such
areas as indicator development, strategy alignment across policy areas, research, and training in
sustainable development policymaking and practices. This approach of MoUs has been implemented
between MPEDIC and NIGSD and can be extended into new areas and replicated throughout the
administration on sustainable development objectives. This is discussed in Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 below.

## Box 1.2. The Public Administration Reform Plan (2014)

The Reform Plan was explicitly developed to increase the effectiveness of the public administration in
Egypt and respond to key contemporary challenges such as the complex organisational structure of the
public administration, the large number of regulations and their overlap, or the lack of transparency and
accountability. In particular, the PARP was built around five pillars containing each several results,
objectives, and actions:

1.  **Increasing the effectiveness of the public administration** through institutional reforms,
    including by restructuring and reorganising government agencies and Ministries through the
    creation of new units;
2.  **Developing public administration and civil servant's capabilities** to increase civil service
    performance and develop their competencies;
3.  **Strengthening the legal framework for civil service reform and management** through
    legislative reforms to develop a conducive and well-defined legal framework for the public
    administration that would increase its agility and support the leadership's capacity to manage
    and deliver;

4.  **Improving and digitalising government services to serve citizens better,** enhance the
    interactions between citizens and the public administration, and enhance the digitalisation and
    functioning of the public administration;
5.  **Improving the governance and the legal framework for Information and IT systems** in
    order to better develop, manage and connect databases across the public administration.

CAOA is also leading the implementation of Governance and Internal Audit units within line ministries.
These units aim to improve the internal governance and audit of public bodies across the public
administration. According to decision No. 54 of 2020, every ministry, governmental body, local
administration, and public agency must take the necessary steps to establish organisational units for
internal audit and governance within their organisational structure. Overall, they aim to (1) ensure the
effective allocation of the body's funds and resources; (2) assure the effectiveness of administrative,
financial, and technical procedures; (3) enhance the adherence to binding legislation, regulations,
instructions, policies, and plans; (4) promote the principles of good governance and apply the values and
standards of internal auditing; and (5) contribute to strengthening the efforts of the State agencies
concerned with preventing corruption.

# Overview of the NIGSD's roles, values, and activities under its new mandate

The evolution of the NIGSD is marked by significant changes in its mandate and jurisdiction. Established as the National Management Institute in 2006 by presidential decree no. 368/2006, it underwent a pivotal transformation in September 2020 when it was reorganised into the NIGSD through Cabinet Decision No. 1880 (see Box 2.1). This change was a strategic response to contemporary challenges and a commitment to advancing Egypt's strategic objectives, such as Egypt Vision 2030 and the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Underpinning this transformation was the inauguration of a new vision for the NIGSD, one that aspires to “promote and support the development of effective governance systems to achieve sustainable development and competitiveness." Concurrently, the institution adopted a reinvigorated mission, dedicated to "disseminating knowledge and skills aimed at cultivating effective and accountable systems of governance for sustainable development” (NIGSD, 2020[1]).

## Box 2.1. The NIGSD's 2020 mandate overhaul

The National Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (NIGSD) has undergone a significant transformation since its establishment in 2006. The new (2020) mandate reflects a comprehensive overhaul of the institution's role, objectives, and organisational structure, aligning it with the evolving needs of Egypt's governance and sustainable development landscape. It represents a significant step forward for the NIGDSD, positioning it as a leading force in Egypt's journey towards sustainable development. The broader scope and enhanced ambition, entail the NIGSD to make a more profound impact on Egypt's governance and sustainable development challenges.

## Table 2.1. Comparing the 2006 and 2020 mandates

| Theme | Mandate of the National Institute of Management (NMI) (2006) | Mandate of the National Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (NIGSD) (2020) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Overall scope** | Narrower focus on management education and training within Egypt. | Broader focus on governance, sustainable development, leadership, innovation, and research with the ambition to be a leading centre for excellence in governance and sustainable development. |
| **Strategic priorities** | Strengthening management practices and providing relevant training and advisory services. | Strategic impact, knowledge creation, leadership development, digitalisation, and global partnerships. |
| **Funding** | Limited financial independence with a primary government budget allocation. | Enhanced financial autonomy and self-reliance with a diversification of funding sources, including fees from services, public-private partnerships, and international grants. |
| **International collaboration** | Limited focus on international partnerships and engagement. | Emphasis on collaboration with leading institutions around the world to become a global centre of excellence. |
| **Digitalisation and innovation Adaptation** | Recognition of the importance of technology. Emphasis on continuous improvement and addressing emerging needs. | Emphasis on leveraging digital technologies and methodologies to become a digital-first institution. Emphasis on continuous improvement with a focus on adapting to rapid technological, economic, and social changes. |

The vision set up a new mandate covering key roles with eight areas of work: (1) promoting good governance practices; (2) reviewing, assessing, and monitoring Egypt's ranking in global, regional and local indices; (3) supporting the development of national strategies and indices; (4) supporting the enhancement of Egypt's performance in global rankings in governance, sustainable development, and competitiveness; (5) developing private and public sector training and consultancy in support of good governance practices; (6) conducting research, data analysis, and surveys; (7) implementing partnerships with national, regional and international research centres and think tanks; and (8) doing training and capacity building workshops on good governance, sustainable development and competitiveness. The key roles can be summarised broadly into three pillars: (1) consultation; (2) training; and (3) research on governance, sustainable development, and competitiveness. As such, the institute serves as the executive "training arm" of MPEDIC on these issues. In particular, it operates as an advisory body and think tank on these areas covering several activities (see Box 2.2) (NIGSD, 2020[1]).

Given MPEDIC's responsibilities, the NIGSD has engaged into more formal and structured ways of collaboration with MPEDIC to ensure robust and systemic cooperation on a number of activities. In particular, the NIGSD and MPEDIC have signed a MoU in 2021 that covers several activities listed in the document:

*   Launching a specialized certificate programme: "Excellence Ambassadors” or Leaders of Change for Excellence;
*   Launching a new award category dedicated to sustainability;
*   Areas of enhancing government innovation;
*   Implementing the award model on the African continent; and
*   Launching the Citizen's Charter.

While MoUs provide a very conducive form of cooperation, this MoU focuses on a series of precise activities and initiatives that have been successfully implemented so far. It could be enriched by adding a number of areas of mutual concern related to sustainable development and governance, for instance contributions of the NIGSD to specific research, analyses and capacity building to support the implementation and monitoring of Egypt Vision 2030.

## Box 2.2. Complete list of activities carried out by the NIGSD

Under the new mandate, the NIGSD shall operate as an advisory body and think tank on the issues of governance, sustainable development, and competitiveness to:

*   Formulate National Governance, Competitiveness, and Sustainable Development indicators.
*   Release periodical Reports.
*   Work towards raising/upgrading the international classification of Egypt in international Governance and Competitiveness Reports.
*   Build and Develop National Cadres.
*   Provide consultancy and training services to private (non-governmental) entities.
*   Conduct research and statistical activities and surveys to enhance national knowledge in governance, competitiveness, and sustainable development, in partnership with national and international research organisations.
*   Establish and activate an integrated information system, help in implementing executive programs to maximise the benefits from large databases.
*   Develop Government management and enhance its efficiency through the continuous training and upgrade of up-to-date technological mechanisms and applications.

*   Activate/encourage participatory development of Governance and Competitiveness through an e-evaluation system based on international evaluation indicators linked in a central network.
*   Collect and publish all efforts exerted by Egypt, National and International, and Civil Society organisations in Governance and Sustainable Development.
*   Establish and manage interactive websites, applications, and social media platforms to provide data on Egypt's classification in Governance indicators, efforts, enhancements, as well as the institute's fields of work.
*   Empower women and those with special needs.
*   Reach out to international cooperation as a means towards better capacity building for representative civil servants, and better consultancy and research services.
*   Support the implementation of Egypt Vision 2030.

The NIGSD's mandate is also aligned with fundamental laws and several key strategies such as the Constitution of the Arab Republic of Egypt 2014, the National Anti-Corruption Strategy 2019-22 and its successor for 2023-2030, the National Strategy for Empowerment of Egyptian Women 2017, the Social Inclusion and Egypt's 2018 Disability Law, and the 2019-2022 Code of Ethics. In addition, the NIGSD updated its core values for effectively delivering on its new mandate around six key areas (NIGSD, 2020[1]):

*   **Innovation:** Explore, create, develop, and integrate progressive innovative products through constant learning and exposure to global practices.
*   **Integrity:** Honesty of purpose, conduct and discipline in actions and respect for all.
*   **Excellence:** To be acknowledged for exceptional standards, performance, and professionalism.
*   **Inclusion and Diversity:** Equal access to opportunities within society (leaving no one behind).
*   **Continuous Quality and Improvement:** Continuous improvement culture based on rigorous monitoring and evaluation.
*   **Commitment:** Complete dedication to our stakeholders, mission, and goals (NIGSD, 2020[1]).

## The NIGSD's unique strategic position within the Egyptian public administration

Consulted interlocutors in the framework of this project confirmed that the NIGSD has carved out a distinctive and influential role within the Egyptian public administration and society on the areas of good governance and sustainable development through its numerous activities and projects. Central in the NIGSD strategic positioning is its ambition to mutually reinforce both topics to become a Centre of Excellence for Good Governance for Sustainable Development. This ambition has driven the institute to engage in a broad array of activities, which mainly focuses on three pillars, namely: training, research, and consulting services.

A key aspect of the NIGSD's strategic position lies in its robust partnerships, both at the international and national level. At the international level, it has gained substantial visibility, collaborating with well-regarded institutions such as Ben Rashid University in Dubai, King's College London, Hertie School of Governance in Germany, Thunderbird School of Global Management in the United States, and the United Nations University in Portugal. This global engagement has facilitated knowledge exchange and has also strongly contributed towards the NIGSD's reputation and attractiveness.

More locally, the institute has also fostered collaborations and projects with various stakeholders inside the public and private sectors, or with civil society organisations and academia, making it a credible and

reference platform on good governance and sustainable development in the Egyptian institutional landscape. These partnerships have generated a high level of credibility and satisfaction among partners, with all interviewed stakeholders in the framework of this project underscoring the positive cooperation and the NIGSD's important contributions to Egypt's good governance and sustainable development efforts. The NIGSD has also appeared as an important partner for a wide range of institutions and strata in the Egyptian environment, including NGOs, public administration, and the private sector, helping to disseminate key aspects of sustainable development in new territories. This topic will be further discussed in more detail in this review's chapter five that focuses on partnerships.

The NIGSD's main areas of work align closely with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), focusing on providing consultancy, technical support, and strategic guidance to government institutions. The institute actively monitors progress in SDG implementation, emphasising the critical link between governance and sustainable development. Furthermore, it plays a pivotal role in raising awareness of sustainable development's importance and fostering cross-sector partnerships to achieve the SDGs. While doing so, the NIGSD seeks to elevate Egypt's standing in international reports and rankings, in turn reflecting the country's strong commitment to sustainable development.

In summary, the National Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development has emerged as a dynamic and influential player in Egypt's public landscape. With a commitment to excellence, a wide range of activities, and strategic partnerships, it is well-positioned to contribute significantly to the nation's pursuit of Good Governance and Sustainable Development, even as it navigates the challenges of evolving mandates and expectations. While training, research, and consulting services form its main areas of work, the NIGSD's diverse range of activities has expanded over time, sometimes straying from its original mandate and objectives in response to emerging opportunities and requests. This includes for instance the affiliation with the Egypt Impact Lab as well as expanding the public governance scope to corporate governance work. This evolution can be deemed both a strength and challenge. While the institute's adaptability has allowed it to address pressing needs, maintaining consistency with its core mission remains an ongoing challenge.

Notwithstanding these developments, the institute's mandate outlined above is now focused on sustainable development, governance and competitiveness, all broadly defined. The mandate is such that the institute can accept, indeed actively seeks, a large range of project proposals from across the broadest of policy spectrums, sometimes stretching its capacity to build strategic competencies in key aspects of good governance and sustainable development that would enable it to build a solid reputation for excellence in these areas nationally and abroad – to build expertise and excellence in key niche-areas of governance and sustainable development that would be readily acknowledged at home and abroad.

This may limit the institute's ability to focus its resources and expertise in governance and sustainable development in a way that reflects the government's evolving needs, and its capacity to revise its governance arrangements to both serve the government and meet its strategic objectives as an institution effectively. Indeed, any agency of this type (and certainly most if not all similar agencies in OECD countries) requires governance arrangements that are fit-for-purpose – that can enable the institution to deliver upon its strategic objectives annually and over time as defined in its planning framework.

This situation has created some level of disparity between the institution's original purpose and its current role and work that has increasingly relied on a large acceptance of the governance scope (public governance, corporate governance, governance for sustainable development). The NIGSD mandate's responsibility areas and how it can effectively support Egyptian institutions, specifically the clarification of its areas of competence and the allocation of responsibilities vis-à-vis other ministries, agencies and bodies, have yet to be fully defined. This omission has resulted in a situation where the division of roles and responsibilities remains sometimes unclear, hindering effective governance and collaboration in some

areas. In this sense, it is essential to further reflect in its mandate the NIGSD's collaborative vocation and how it is aligning with the government's evolving needs and revised governance arrangements.

The Institute recognises the challenges posed by its current funding model, which relies solely on project-based revenues from clients. Historically, the institute has emphasised its lack of institutional financial support from governments or the private sector as a testament to its independence. While this stance has its merits, experiences in OECD countries suggest that such independence does not always align with institutional autonomy. In response to these challenges, the Institute has proactively secured new sources of funding to enhance its financial stability in order to provide the institute with strategic and operational funding that is more autonomous and stable, thereby reinforcing institutional independence without relying solely on the goodwill of their public and private clients.

As such there seems to be a growing need for a comprehensive review and update of the NIGSD's legal mandate in line with the mission statement and enable the institution to engage in meaningful strategic planning so that it can better align its activities with the government's evolving needs, focus on key critical, strategic aspects of governance and sustainable development to build niche experience and excellence that are universally recognised, and address any missing elements related to responsibility areas and align budget needs accordingly. The NIGSD has developed a mission statement that embraces its current areas of work and priorities that can help support strategic planning and budgetary planning, and that can provide a strong basis for its annual work plans. The next section examines this issue and opportunity in greater detail.

# An updated mission statement that better defines the NIGSD's strategic role and scope

## Strategic planning

The OECD emphasises the importance of strategic frameworks for organisations as they provide a guiding structure for organisations to achieve their goals, address challenges, and leverage their comparative advantages (OECD, 2020[5]). as defined by its mandate. The NIGSD develops annual plans setting critical activities, but the institution lacks a comprehensive strategic framework that encompasses its vision, mission, strategic objectives, and expected outcomes over the mid to long-term, to retain consistency with its core mission as defined by its mandate.

To strengthen its strategic framework, the NIGSD has recently developed an overarching strategic document in the format of a mission statement that constitutes the very basis of a much-needed strategic framework for its activities and can help the NIGSD effectively govern and communicate on its annual and longer-term activities. The mission statement of the NIGSD creates a link with Egypt Vision 2030 and the SDGs and enacts a vision and a mission for the NIGSD articulated around its three key pillars and values (NIGSD, 2023[6]):

> Promote and support the development of effective governance systems to achieve competitiveness and sustainable development.

The statement reflects the development of the activities and themes addressed by the NIGSD notably since the revision of its mandate. The mission statement provides a clear structure of the activities of the NIGSD as per its mandate, that resonates with its vision and mission and covers the three pillars of good governance, competitiveness, and sustainable development (Figure 2.1). These elements provide a strong basis for the NIGSD legitimacy and work scope that could be further communicated and displayed on NIGSD website and communication materials. It is essential that future annual plans developed by the NIGSD are aligned with the mission statement and refer to its objectives and activities. Based on this

mission statement, the NIGSD could also consider developing a multi-year strategic planning document that could be framed according to the mission statement and be the basis for annual plans.

## Figure 2.1. NIGSD activities as per its mandate

**NIGSD's Mandate**

At its core, this strategic framework should serve as a lighthouse, illuminating the NIGSD's distinctive value proposition within the constellation of activities undertaken by a myriad of institutions, both within and outside the government, that share a focus on these three pillars. By explicitly delineating its unique role and objectives, the statement seeks to establish a clear and distinct identity for NIGSD in the midst of these coordinated efforts. In addition, concentrating activities in a small number of key areas in good governance and sustainable development of strategic importance to both the GoE, especially MPEDIC, and other clients, can enable the institute to build niche expertise and excellence that it can then market both at home and abroad to raise awareness of its activities and strengthen its client base in these key areas.

This framework statement has been subject to government-wide presentations and introductions to ensure legitimacy and buy-in across government during meetings attended by the Executive Director of the NIGSD. While this does not constitute per se a formal, official and extensive consultation mechanism, it has helped define, share and communicate on the NIGSD mission statement and profile. Such a framework should indeed not be confined to internal use but should also be shared and communicated with relevant stakeholders across Egypt. This inclusive approach aims to foster a shared understanding of NIGSD's role and encourage fruitful collaboration with key stakeholders such as CAOA, CAPMAS, ACA, and other relevant entities (and their Sustainable Development Units) in Egypt. By doing so, the NIGSD can ensure clarity in its objectives, maintain focus, prevent mission overlap with other institutions, and avoid perceived mission drift, thereby enhancing its effectiveness in promoting governance and sustainable development initiatives within the country.

This mission statement establishes clear links with the objectives and activities planned in Egypt Vision 2030 led by MPEDIC. In that regard, the dedicated strategic partnership with MPEDIC is essential for the NIGSD to clearly articulate the benefits of such collaboration to leverage synergies. The NIGSD and MPEDIC have engaged over recent years into further formalisation of their collaboration, by signing a MoU and establishing a joint Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee comprises 9 members. These efforts should help share a common understanding of good governance for sustainable development and ensure consistency across the societal efforts to implement the Egypt Vision 2030.

To translate its strategic priorities into action, the NIGSD employs detailed annual implementation plans, subject to regular review and updates in collaboration with experts and counsellors. Indeed, the development of a vision/mission statement also holds the potential to facilitate the formulation of detailed strategic objectives, action plans, and institutional performance indicators. These plans should be further connected to the mission statement to ensure that they respond and address the strategic priorities and activities identified in the mission statement and help gauge NIGSD's impact and measuring the effectiveness of its initiatives in advancing the cause of governance, competitiveness, and sustainable development in Egypt. The institute's Board of Trustees, composed of experts in governance, public administration, law, and related fields, provides vital guidance for effective implementation. Last, the institute currently produces annual reports, these should be closely linked to the framework statement and strategic objectives to provide a more holistic view of its activities and impact. Moving forward, the NIGSD could further establish a mid-term strategic document that articulates its goals with clear and detailed activities for the coming years, preferably within a 3–5-year timeframe, based on which the annual plans can be developed. This optional additional document can provide a link between the high-level mission statement and the operational annual plan.

In addition, the Strategic Planning Unit that was newly established in 2024 plays an important role in realising the NIGSD's strategic framework. Specifically tasked with reviewing and updating the Institute's vision, mission, and values, and identifying strategic focus areas, this unit ensures that the strategic framework is dynamic and responsive to both internal and external challenges, thereby strengthening NIGSD's ability to fulfil its strategic objectives.

The mission and vision statement have defined an important strategic framework for NIGSD and should be further operationalised; they should serve as a dynamic framework that guides the work of NIGSD, fosters understanding among all stakeholders, and fuels the pursuit of good governance, competitiveness, and sustainable development in Egypt, ultimately contributing to the realisation of Egypt's Vision 2030. While they have a different legal and administrative set-up, KDZ being a non-profit public organisation and CIFAL Flanders being a centre of expertise and training, their experiences could prove a compelling reference point for the NIGSD's strategic positioning efforts (see Box 2.3 and Box 2.4 respectively).

**Box 2.3. KDZ – Centre for Public Administration Research: Vision, role, and activities**

KDZ is a non-profit public organisation based in Vienna (Austria) that promotes the strengthening of the public sector and public governance. Founded in 1969, KDZ offers research, consulting, and training services with a focus on the public sector, including cities, municipalities, states, federal government, and the European level. Despite not being directly linked to any ministry or public institution, the centre is funded by cities, regions and ministries who are members.

KDZ's vision is to promote an efficient and effective state, which requires a public administration that is based on the principles of democracy, ethics, quality, transparency, participation, impact orientation, responsibility, sustainability, and economic efficiency. The Centre's mission is to enhance good governance by providing applied research advice and training for the public sector. In 2000, KDZ was appointed as CAF-Resource centre (i.e., European Common Assessment Framework for Better Quality and Governance in Public Sector Organisations) by the Austrian Federal Chancellery.

The Centre's thematic expertise spans Public Management Consulting, European Governance & Urban Policy, Public Finance & Federalism, and Further Education.

KDZ has also established itself as a well-recognised training partner. Its education work focuses on the specific requirements of the public administrations it works with. As a result, the topics covered in the sessions are varied, including for instance courses on economic efficiency and financial management, municipal budget reform, and communication, as well as networking events.

Furthermore, since 2022 participants in these trainings can choose from a balanced mix of online webinars via Zoom and in-person formats. The methodology of these practically oriented trainings is practical and relies on a large network of experienced practitioners from different areas of the administration, as well as academic experts in the field.

In terms of deliverables, KDZ primarily focuses on applied research commissioned by organisations, with projects ranging from short peer reviews to long-term research projects. Furthermore, as a public organisation, KDZ publishes its reviews on its website and other platforms, as agreed with the contracting institutions. For this purpose, KDZ has a knowledge centre offering information about all activities of the institute. In addition to studies and publications, the knowledge centre publishes a newsletter on current KDZ projects, as well as a more extensive journal (the Forum Public Management), an annual report on its activities and services, and the so-called "white papers", which provide interested readers with the latest thoughts and positions of the KDZ experts on a wide variety of public sector issues.

Finally, as the Austrian CAF-Resource centre, KDZ is responsible for providing training and supporting current users of the framework as well as parties interested in implementing it. Moreover, KDZ's CAF-Centre also acts as the contact point and an international advisor for the implementation of the framework in all public sector organisations worldwide.

**Box 2.4. CIFAL Flanders: Vision, role, and activities**

CIFAL Flanders is a centre of expertise and training on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) affiliated to the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) and established as a Foundation of Public Utility in 2012. Officially named 'Centre International de Formation des Autorités et Acteurs Locaux', CIFAL Flanders' trainings are targeted to public authorities, private sector, and civil society leaders, with a particular focus on businesses.

CIFAL Flanders' vision is to strengthen a just transition towards a sustainable society and economy through capacity building of all actors in society. In line with this vision, the training centre's mission is to promote peace, human rights and sustainable development and the declarations, principles, and guidelines of the United Nations, with focus on the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs. To materialise its vision and mission, CIFAL Flanders offers trainings, project development services and coaching, with SDG 4.7 as its key target (i.e., education for sustainable development and global citizenship). In its activities, CIFAL Flanders relies on an "Action Learning" methodology to facilitate knowledge transfer, enhance capabilities, and encourage multi-stakeholder partnerships among government officials, private sector leaders, and civil society.

The Centre's thematic areas cover Urban Governance and Planning, Economic Development, Social Inclusion, Environmental Sustainability, and Cross-cutting themes. Its core expertise revolves around UN frameworks, notably the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 SDGs, the New Urban Agenda (Habitat III), the 10 UN Global Compat principles, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (Ruggie Framework), and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Furthermore, the Centre has recently developed expertise in Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence, aligning with the new EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). CIFAL Flanders has a wide catalogue of tailor-made training courses. To ensure that the exercise is relevant and tailored to their specific

needs, participants have the possibility to fill in an online form detailing their learning objectives and expectations. The portfolio includes expert lectures, five-half-days-long ToT sessions, masterclasses and bootcamps to train the organisation to become an SDG ambassador and learn how to use the SDG training manual, as well as a 2-days-long summer academy.

Finally, as a UNITAR-affiliated centre of expertise and training, CIFAL Flanders belongs to a global network of 31 centres with the mandate to enhance effectiveness of the UN through diplomatic training and through public awareness-raising, education and training of public policy officials and other key national change agents. This gives the centre a unique position of being a UN-embedded organisation, working with global agendas and core texts like the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Due to this affiliation, the centre's activities are closely monitored and assessed by UNITAR. As part of this oversight, CIFAL Flanders reports quarterly on KPIs for its activities to UNITAR based on a quality scheme that includes five key questions, with the option to add more if required.

## Budgetary Autonomy

As mentioned above, the NIGSD positions itself as an independent agency because it does not rely on budgetary allocations from the government. The institute argues that this independence enables it to be responsive to specific requests and that this enables the institute to maintain its financial freedom to focus on Governance for Sustainable Development.

Institutional independence is indeed an important feature of this type of agency, and the NIGSD 's ability to hold up its independence is a hallmark of how it carries out its mandate. An agency's autonomy is both an intrinsic institutional value and a tool to enable the institution to exercise effective decision-making when discussing priorities with its clients and interlocutors – the capacity to decline work requests when these lie beyond its mandate and strategic objectives -- and most importantly to provide neutral evidence-based advice free from political interference or bias. That said, as mentioned above, evidence in OECD countries suggests that the absence of a stable, predictable source of operational funding can in fact compromise institutional independence, because the agency becomes beholden to the vagaries of project fundraising and to the whims of existing and prospective clients.

In OECD countries, a range of funding formulae can define the nature of the “arm's-length relationship" with the government of which it is a part – the degree of independence/autonomy from government of agencies with similar mandates to the NIGSD's. There are gradations of autonomy (related mostly to financial and administrative governance), that define the nature and scope of the relationship the agency has with its ministry or government. For example, some agencies have boards of directors or boards of trustees that are appointed by the government/minister, while others self-appoint (moving it further away from government influence). Some agencies benefit from stable annual parliamentary appropriations that are granted in specific legislation (and are therefore not subject to the vagaries of the annual national budget-setting process), while others have been granted fiscal capacity to raise their own funds through user-fees, etc.

Still others benefit from revenues from one or more endowment funds that were set up through legislation when the agency was created. This is the case of Canada's Institute for Research on Public Policy (IRPP) – see Box 2.5. Indeed, the IRPP is legally defined not as an arm's-length government agency but as a charitable institution for governance and tax purposes, notwithstanding the fact that its endowment funding was granted through Parliamentary appropriations. This renders the IRPP's core annual operating budgets completely autonomous from government funding and affords the institute the freedom and operational

| 29
stability to choose only those research projects and activities that will advance its strategic priorities and objectives as it has defined for itself in its planning framework.

The point of providing the details on the various types of Canadian arm's length arrangements both here and in Box 2.5 is to illustrate that many formulas are possible to guarantee a degree of independence from government - many of these include some form of government funding - while strengthening the agency's operational stability and its autonomy in making decisions about how best to pursue its mission, mandate and strategic objectives. All these arrangements confirm an agency's independence in one form or another from the ministry within whose portfolio it is a part.

Egypt could thus consider assessing OECD practice in this area to strengthen the financial independence of the NIGSD in a way that would decrease its operational – and existential -- dependence on project funding, and strengthen its capacity to focus its work on key areas of governance and sustainable development of strategic importance to itself, the GoE and the country, thus consolidating its reputation for excellence in these areas both at home and abroad.

It is also important to note that the institute is aware of the challenges associated with its current funding model. To address this, they have successfully garnered support from a variety of respected funding entities. Their main supporters include UNDP, which funds several training programs like She for a Digital Future; the Sawiris Foundation, supporting international programs; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); GIZ, which funds projects such as the Manual for People with Disabilities and online courses on atingi.org; the Hans Seidel Foundation, backing initiatives like Salah, Omneya, and the SDGs; and significant contributions from the banking sector, including Abu Dhabi Bank and the National Banks of Egypt and Misr. Additionally, UN Women supports their courses on gender equality. These partnerships not only diversify their funding sources but also enhance operational capabilities.

Recently, the Institute has also embarked on two new initiatives to strengthen its financial independence. Firstly, a new Data Centre is currently under construction behind their premises in collaboration with Huawei, designed to offer renting spaces to both the public and private sectors. Secondly, they are expanding their services to the private and banking sectors while actively seeking new grants and partnerships. For public entities unable to afford their services, arrangements can be made through MPEDIC for potential fee waivers, subject to ministerial approval. This strategic approach aims to contribute to a more stable and autonomous funding structure, reinforcing their independence from the fluctuating support of various clients.

# Box 2.5. Canada: Arm's length governance and IRPP budget autonomy

## Governance "at arm's length" for public agencies
*   In Canada, agencies, boards and commissions are established to carry out administrative, adjudicative, regulatory and advisory functions within the government's policy and legislative framework. These institutions are involved in a broad range of activities, such as protecting human rights, regulating specific economic sectors, providing services, undertaking research and providing advice. They usually operate at arm's length from government and the degree of their autonomy varies considerably by their organisation and function.
*   These institutions are usually created by legislation, which sets out the entity's mandate, authorities and organisational structures. The legislation normally also contains details on the composition of the organisation and the roles and responsibilities of key actors (e.g., chair, the board of directors, chief executive officer). In contrast to ministries/departments which are under the control and direction of a Minister, agencies are frequently structured on a corporate model in which decision-making powers are vested in a board of directors. That board is accountable to Parliament and the public for the exercise of the agency's mandate.
*   The degree of independence from government of agencies and public (crown) corporations is defined and regulated under the federal Financial Administration Act (FAA). The FAA defines different clusters of agencies and crown corporations, each benefitting from varying degrees of autonomy from government, while maintaining a robust public accountability framework that is exercised through the agency's board of directors and chief executive. Among others, these clusters include:
    *   Departmental agencies included in Schedule I of the FAA have more narrowly defined mandates than ministerial departments, which are generally specified in their enabling instrument. Their specific functions differ widely, and they operate with varying degrees of independence.
    *   Departmental corporations, specialised entities established through legislation and included under Schedule II of the FAA. They are financed largely through parliamentary appropriations (and some user fees) and typically have a governing council or other form of management board/board of directors. Service agencies, a specialised form of departmental corporation established through tailored legislation to perform a highly operational function or service for which there is usually no private sector competition. Service agencies are financed through parliamentary appropriations and user fees. Each service agency's governing management board and individual organisational arrangements and responsibilities are prescribed by its legislation and, as a consequence, each has varying levels of autonomy.
    *   Crown corporations are government organisations that operate following a private sector model, but usually have a mixture of commercial and public policy objectives. Crown corporations are directly owned by the Government of Canada and are established through legislation, letters patent, or articles of incorporation under the Canada Business Corporations Act.

## Canada's Institute for Research on Public Policy: operational autonomy
*   The Institute for Research on Public Policy (IRPP) lies further away from the government on the "arm's length spectrum" than do the agencies, commissions and crown corporations highlighted above; it is in fact not a government agency, but an independent, national, bilingual, not-for-profit organisation based in Montreal, Quebec. Indeed, the Institute is a registered charitable

institution under the Income Tax Act and is incorporated under Part II of the Canada Corporations Act.
    *   Its mission is to "improve public policy in Canada by generating research, providing insight and informing debate on current and emerging policy issues facing Canadians and their governments."
*   It publishes peer-reviewed research and acts as a convenor of policy debates by organizing conferences, round tables and panel discussions among stakeholders, academics, policymakers, and the general public. It is also the publisher of Policy Options magazine and the home of the Centre of Excellence on the Canadian Federation
*   The IRPP was created as a result of a commitment by the government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau in 1968 to establish an "independent and autonomous" institute for public policy research, whose work would be "available to all governments”.
*   The IRPP's main source of revenue is an endowment created when it was established:
    *   The Federal government contributed CAD 10 million,
    *   Provincial governments and business contributed a further CAD 10 million
    *   An additional endowment of $10 million (from Government of Canada) was granted in 2019 to establish the Centre of Excellence on the Canadian Federation
*   Its board of directors has 16 members, hailing from across Canada. The Chair and Directors of the board are appointed by the members of the Institute. The Institute's President is appointed by the board of directors following a competitive, merit-based recruitment process.
*   The founding principles of the IRPP state that "the Institute should dedicate itself to impartial service of the national cultures, the various regions and the various governments of the people of Canada in its research and analysis on public policy questions."
*   Spending in 2022-23: $3.5 million. Full time staff in 2022-23: 23

# Competitiveness: a key area of the NIGSD's mission with comparatively less activity

The activities of the NIGSD largely evolve around two of the three themes mentioned both in the mandate and in the mission statement: governance and sustainable development. Consulting, research and capacity building activities widely cover those two themes. Importantly enough, the link between those two themes, particularly how good governance can support sustainable development is a major area of thinking and work of the NIGSD. However, it appears that the link with competitiveness and this theme in general do not receive the same attention.

The mission statement of the NIGSD includes an objective on supporting competitiveness in Egypt as part of its vision. The competitiveness theme is also explicitly mentioned in the original mandate of the NIGSD (Government of Egypt, 2020[14]). Through its work and activities, NIGSD could help achieve competitiveness-related objectives of Egypt Vision 2030, thus creating another clear connection between the work of the NIGSD and the long-term objectives of Egypt displayed in the latest version of Egypt Vision 2030. Developing a competitive economy, that is also well-balanced and diversified, is a central goal of Egypt Vision 2030, which is reflected in its objective four (“Competitive and diversified knowledge economy") and across virtually all other objectives. Egypt Vision 2030 also connects competitiveness and governance in its objective six on “Enhancing governance and partnerships”, highlighting the importance of competitiveness at the local level and the key roles played by partnerships particularly with the private sector to enhance investment and competitiveness.

The NIGSD has developed a number of activities on competitiveness over the years, including looking at several competitiveness indices as part of its annual Egypt's Performance in Governance Indices, and overseeing the Egypt Entrepreneurship and Innovation Center (EEIC). NIGSD's report on Egypt's Performance in Governance Indices also includes few indicators and indexes linked to Competitiveness, particularly the Global Sustainable Competitive Indicators, that are discussed in the report (NIGSD, 2023[15]). The EEIC was created in June 2023 as a hub for sustainable entrepreneurship that support business development, innovation and the knowledge economy, which are important drivers of competitiveness (NIGSD, n.d.[16]) (Egypt Entrepreneurship and Innovation Centre, 2024[17]). The NIGSD has also been working on several projects with public and private sector to support competitiveness and governance, particularly on the topic of corporate governance.

Competitiveness is a broad concept that spans across many policy areas, including governance, which calls for further exploring the role and value-added of the NIGSD on this theme. The Word Economic Forum (WEF) identifies 12 pillars for competitiveness computed into the Global Competitiveness Index. Institutions is the first of these pillars, and has broad acceptance of the notion of institutions, covering security, transparency, checks and balances, public sector performance or the future orientation of government. As noted in Egypt Vision 2030, Egypt's competitiveness needs to be supported by economic diversification, a conducive business and investment climate, solid economic and legal conditions in several policy areas and enhanced governance and partnerships. Among public governance issues that impact competitiveness and investment in Egypt, the legal framework, the performance of the public sector and transparency appear to be some of the areas that need most improvements in Egypt and could be further studied by the NIGSD (World Economic Forum, 2020[18]) (OECD, 2020[19]) (Egypt's Ministry of Economic Development and Planning, 2023[20]).

Additionally, while the NIGSD's mission statement identifies competitiveness as a key pillar, it is probably the theme of the mandate that could gain for more developments and visibility. The presence of competitiveness in the NIGSD mandate and its connection with governance and other areas in Egypt Vision 2030 opens several avenues for NIGSD to work on the topic, and to work more closely with its government partners, starting with MPEDIC, on these matters. NIGSD's mission statement mentions activities related to assessing and enhancing Egypt's rankings in global competitiveness indexes and providing consulting, capacity building and training on competitiveness, as well as supporting dialogue and communication. Competitiveness is a wide horizontal topic that can be addressed by many public, private and research institutions depending on the angle of analysis (private sector development, competitiveness, infrastructure, economic development, etc.). In Egypt, the WEF Global Competitiveness Index work is for instance supported by the Egyptian Centre for Economic Studies (ECES) (World Economic Forum, 2020[18]).

Within the wide scope of competitiveness, the NIGSD could define its own value-added and activities, particularly on the further analysing and monitoring indices on competitiveness through dedicated annual publications, on developing its research activities for instance through policy papers connecting international performance and local developments, and the links between public governance, competitiveness, and sustainable development. As part of its mandate, the NIGSD must monitor Egypt rankings in international competitiveness indicators, which could be translated into a more detailed section and analysis of these indexes in its report on indicators. The role of public governance to support competitiveness, especially more sustainable and inclusive competitiveness, has been highlighted by a number of reports and indices, including the Global Competitiveness Index and could be a specific axe of analysis for the NIGSD, especially if it were to work in partnership with other key actors in this area, notably with MPEDIC and the Ministry of Finance. The NIGSD could develop more research on competitiveness, by providing detailed analysis on competitiveness factors and indicators or by further engaging with the public and the private sector to improve competitiveness. The NIGSD could also engage with the ECES to develop local research and analysis on Egypt's competitiveness, and with international partners like the Harvard Growth Lab to further study Egypt's challenges underlined by international indices. Finally,

competitiveness is also increasingly studied with a sustainable and responsible business conduct angle, for instance in the Global Sustainable Competitiveness Index but also in OECD Investment Policy Reviews, which the NIGSD could further explore in Egypt.

# Overview of tailored and actionable recommendations to consolidate the strategic positioning of the NIGSD

The following actionable recommendations will help the NIGSD to consolidate its strategic positioning and enhance its impact in promoting good governance for sustainable development and competitiveness in Egypt. These actions aim not only to provide clarity and focus to the institute's mission but also to foster collaboration and engagement with key stakeholders across the government and non-government sectors.

## Strengthen and operationalise the NIGSD mission statement to reinforce the strategic framework:
*   Complement the mission statement with a clear and concise definition of "governance for sustainable development" that will offer the much-needed clarity through the NIGSD main area of work.
*   More clearly outline the principles, practices, and goals that the NIGSD aims to demonstrate for advancing good governance for sustainable development and competitiveness.

## Ensure the NIGSD's mandate is fit-for-purpose:
*   To enable NIGSD to pursue its mission effectively, review and update the NIGSD's legal mandate to ensure its alignment with the government's evolving needs and revised governance arrangements and give practical effect to this updated mandate through a robust strategic planning framework (see next recommendation).
*   Specify the NIGSD's jurisdiction and its assigned responsibilities vis-à-vis other ministries and agencies. To organise this work concretely, a dedicated ad hoc task force consisting of representatives from the NIGSD, MPEDIC, CAOA, CAPMAS and other key partnering institutions could be created to discuss and clarify collaboratively the jurisdictional aspects and responsibilities. NIGSD could consider negotiating a formal MoU with these partners to codify role, responsibilities, deliverables and timelines in these areas of mutual concern as was done with MPEDIC.

## Develop a full-fledged strategic planning framework to support the mission statement:
*   Ensure the link between the mission statement and the annual action plans to make sure that the action plans contribute to the strategic objectives and activities of the mission statement and of the mandate.
*   leverage the mission statement and updated mandate to develop a 5-year strategic document translating the mission statement into priority activities and indicators that can provide a basis for the annual plans. This framework should be structured around the key themes of good governance for sustainable development and competitiveness and could be aligned with the timeline of Egypt Vision 2030.
*   Define specific, measurable, and time-bound objectives and targets for the core activities and priorities identified in the mission statement; these KPIs can be included within this new strategic document to guide the NIGSD's efforts in these areas, and then be cascaded down into the annual action plans. These should include performance indicators and data-collection capacity to enable NIGSD to measure the impact of its performance on the pursuit of its strategic

*   objectives as outlined in its strategic planning framework, and to report to itself, the government and the public on the progress the institute is making in achieving these objectives.
*   Further develop the area of competitiveness that can gain more importance on par with the level of developments of activities in the areas of good governance and sustainable development. The NIGSD could consider developing a specific action plan on competitiveness that would run through its different activities (research, consulting, training, and capacity building) and identify internal capabilities to be able to develop and deliver the actions related to competitiveness. This could also be a dedicated section of the annual action plans prepared by the NIGSD. More concretely, the NIGSD could focus particularly on the monitoring of indices, its research activities and the links between public governance, competitiveness, and sustainable development; competitiveness could be added to the annual report on indices in a dedicated section or could be the focus of a specific report.
*   Ensure that the NIGSD has the internal capacity and tools to monitor progress, track performance indicators, and regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation of the annual action plans according to the responsibilities assigned through the Advisory Committee, and discuss this progress and needed actions in the Advisory Committee.
*   Continue to implement and update the MoU with MPEDIC and ensure that ongoing and new activities help Egypt in general and MPEDIC in particular to pursue and reach its sustainable development objectives as part of Egypt Vision 2030, adding for instance activities on research on SDGs attainment or specific analyses on key priorities and indicators of Egypt Vision 2030, and activities on capacity building for the SD units in line Ministries in cooperation with MPEDIC.

## Strengthen budget autonomy for operational independence:

*   To strengthen the institute's financial independence and lessen its exclusive reliance on project financing to carry out its mission and mandate and pursue its strategic planning objectives, the NIGSD could conduct an assessment of key funding formulae that provide similar agencies in OECD countries with stable and predictable ongoing core operational funding, thereby strengthening their independence from government and clients.
*   In so doing, NIGSD could engage with its key relevant government interlocutors on the basis of a strategic plan that NIGSD could design that presents the rationale and options to provide the institute with stable operational funding, so that the agency is better positioned to focus more clearly on its core mandate and responsibilities and thus contribute more effectively to supporting its partners, notably MPEDIC.

## Engage stakeholders and communicate on the mission statement:

*   Continue to actively communicate and engage with all relevant government stakeholders, such as MPEDIC, ACA, CAPMAS, and other relevant entities (for instance line Ministries' Sustainable Development Units on SDGs) to present the mission statement and discuss potential activities on this basis. Tailor the statement to address the specific needs and interests of these stakeholders, highlighting how the NIGSD's work aligns with their objectives.
*   As per the recommendation above, work to establish dedicated strategic partnerships, for instance through MoUs as is done with MPEDIC, with relevant government and non-government actors, including ACA on anti-corruption, CAOA on training and integrity, and CAPMAS on data collection and analysis, the Egyptian Centre for Economic Studies on competitiveness to create a mutually beneficial relationship that will advance the GoE's (and notably the NIGSD's and MPEDIC's) strategic objectives for good governance, sustainable development, and competitiveness in Egypt.

*   Continue efforts to communicate on the institute's mission statement and involve non-government stakeholders, such as civil society organisations, academia, and private sector representatives. Their constant input and communication can provide valuable insights and support for the NIGSD's activities and mission.
*   Develop a comprehensive communication and outreach strategy that is aligned with the new strategic document and the concept of good governance for sustainable development. Ensure that the strategy outlines clear objectives, target audiences, messaging, and channels.
*   Utilise social media platforms, the official website, and other relevant communication channels to disseminate the mission statement and information about the NIGSD's mission, objectives, and activities. Regularly share updates, success stories, and relevant research to engage stakeholders and the wider public.

# 3 Strengthening the NIGSD internal structure and functioning to deliver on its ambitions in Egypt

This chapter examines the internal governance structure of the NIGSD and highlights opportunities to formalise its collaborative relationship with the MPEDIC. It emphasises the need for increased research capacity and internal co-ordination, and presents recommendations to help strengthen governance transparency, build strategic capacities and develop a stable financial strategy to support NIGSD's long-term objectives.

## A well-defined governance and leadership structure

The internal governance of the NIGSD is crucial for the NIGSD to deliver on its mandate and to lead by example. A sound, transparent and inclusive governance is needed to provide the NIGSD with the needed capacities, guidance, and autonomy to carry out its mandate and key activities, and to engage with key national and international partners. Its focus on public governance makes the topic even more important for the NIGSD's credibility in the field.

The governance and executive leadership structure of the NIGSD is designed with attention to effectiveness and inclusivity. At the very top stands the Board of Trustees, responsible for guiding the institute's overall direction (NIGSD, 2023[1]). This Board, chaired by the Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation (MPEDIC), is appointed every three years by the Prime Minister and comprises a diverse array of nine stakeholders that reflects the NIGSD's dedication to independence and inclusivity, as it includes governance experts from academia, the private sector, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), with an emphasis on gender equality. The board designates the Executive Director who leads the general conduct of business with the support of a management team.

While the Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation has a constant presence on the Board, the other members may vary with each appointment cycle. The selection process involves the Minister proposing a list of potential members to the Prime Minister, who makes the final selections primarily based on their expertise. The Board is reported to rotate every three years. It is important that this process is supported by an open and transparent process and criteria that can underpin merit-based appointment.

To foster transparency, meeting notes could be made available to the public on the NIGSD's website within reasonable limits. The creation of the Board of Trustees has been reported to be supported by-laws, such as those within CIFAL Flanders that promote gender equality (see Box 3.1). These by-laws entitle the Board to approve new units, hires, activities, partnerships, and annual plans. The Board is also required to meet at least three times a year. To bolster effectiveness, the Board needs to ensure that the annual plans are aligned and contribute to the achievements of the new mission statement and of key priorities. Accountability can be enhanced through regular monitoring of workplan implementation and the publication of annual reports as is the case by KDZ (see Box 3.2).

Finally, while the participation of the Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation reflects engagement, it is prudent to contemplate codifying the role and powers of the leadership of the Board of Trustees to allow the NIGSD to be at arm's length from the government.

# Box 3.1. Organisational structure of CIFAL Flanders and by-laws regulating gender equality

CIFAL Flanders is headed by an Executive Director and has a Board of Directors composed of representatives from municipalities, institutions, the private sector, academia and UNITAR, many of whom are also strategic partners of the centre. In addition, the Audit & Remuneration committee occupies a prominent position in the organisation chart. This body is in charge of supervising the centre's use of its annual budget of 480,000 euros, as well as the project grants, which represent about 18% of said budget. The institute is supported by voluntary contributions from governments, international organisations, foundations, and other private sources.

CIFAL Flanders has internal regulations that establish procedures for good governance. In addition, a number of by-laws regulate the functioning of the centre, including one on gender equality. The centre has a lean team of only four full-time staff members and four trainees. This team responds on an ad-hoc basis to training requests and relies on an “Action Learning" methodology to facilitate knowledge transfer, enhance capabilities, and encourage multi-stakeholder partnerships among government officials, private sector leaders, and civil society.

As a member of the CIFAL Global network of affiliated training centres, CIFAL Flanders frequently reports on its activities to UNITAR. Every centre is overseen by a host institution, while UNITAR offers academic content, technical assistance, and quality assurance measures to support their training initiatives. This allows each CIFAL to prioritise action in specific thematic axes, depending on local needs and priorities. UNITAR is also headed by an Executive Director and governed by a Board of Trustees. The United Nations Secretary-General appoints members to the Board of Trustees on a personal basis, drawing upon their diverse perspectives from government, philanthropic organisations, academia, and the private sector. The Executive Director, also appointed by the UN Secretary-General, reports directly to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

# Box 3.2. KDZ evaluates self-assessment performance and produces an annual report

KDZ uses financial indicators for self-assessment of its performance alongside feedback from their clients to assess their work and organise lessons-learned sessions after each project.

As a public organisation, KDZ also publishes an annual report summarising the centre's activities, results, figures, and statistics. Since 2010 this exercise also includes an annual "Intellectual Capital Report" which measures the centre's intellectual assets. This document contains human resources statistics, such as staff structure, qualifications, and division of work between internal and external staff. It also details structural resources such as library materials and project metrics, as well as network resources, which include supporters, followers, and participants in activities. Finally, the report also details the share of revenue for the year, which is equally divided between research projects, consulting projects and seminars.

# Fostering collaboration with MPEDIC as the main but autonomous service provider

In Egypt's current institutional landscape, the NIGSD holds a central role as the primary service provider to the MPEDIC and operates in fields, particularly sustainable development, that are in the realm of the MPEDIC mandate.

These two entities are intrinsically linked, that is reflected in their organisational structures, with the Minister of MPEDIC chairing the Board of Trustees of the NIGSD, and in the themes they address. This cooperation has been increasingly formalised and codified over the past years with the signature of a MoU in 2021 and the establishment of an Advisory Committee. As previously noted, the MoU covers several actions and activities that have been jointly implemented and could be further extended to new themes and activities particularly on research on sustainable development and competitiveness topics. The Advisory Committee is composed of 9 members from NIGSD and MPEDIC and has been in place for the past 3 years. The committee includes representatives of the Institute's different teams and aims to help assign responsibilities and action plans for each team. The Committee appears as a cornerstone of the relations to create synergies in the implementation of Egypt Vision 2030 and help to ensure that both entities effectively align their efforts to achieve shared objectives and for instance that NIGSD's activities can best support the ambitions of the MPEDIC on sustainable development goals.

In addition, there is active dialogue and interactions between the NIGSD and MPEDIC, including at the highest levels, that also include additional specific requests from MPEDIC to work on new projects and initiatives. Intensifying these interactions at the operational level, especially with the strategic planning unit and the SD unit of the MPEDIC and the governance centre of the NIGSD are important to ensure fluid relations and work cooperation.

Given NIGSD's research capabilities, its analytical reports and research work could be developed in the areas of sustainable development and linked with key objectives and themes of Egypt Vision 2030. For instance, some analytical work, studies and papers could focus on Egypt's progress and potential to reach some of the goals in Egypt 2030, looking at national and international initiatives, with research on key objectives like social justice and equality (objective 2 of Egypt Vision 2030), inclusion and inequality (objective 2.2), addressing climate change (objective 3.1), boosting the knowledge economy and its competitiveness (objective 4), promoting transparency and combating corruption (objective 6.2), and public administration and governance reform (objective 6) (Government of Egypt, 2023[4]). This would provide independent, in-depth analytical views, looking at progress, obstacles and practices, to support the implementation and the goals of Egypt Vision 2030 on themes such as governance, poverty or competitiveness.

This would also support MPEDIC coordinating and monitoring efforts that do not always allow the Ministry to carry out in-depth research and analytical work on some aspects and objectives. The choice of topics for further research and analysis could be one of the agenda items of the Advisory Committee. It could be also useful to mandate SDU units or SMUs to interface with the NIGSD, and other bodies like MPEDIC or CAPMAS, on matters relating to performance information and KPIs, ensuring that indicators and targets are progressively more aligned across all government strategies; In this context, the NIGSD could take a more active role and systematic approach in monitoring policy outcomes on good governance, sustainability, and competitiveness The NIGSD could also actively participate in cross-government co-ordination mechanisms, particularly those focusing on SDG and Vision 2030 implementation, SDG localisation, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) development. This involvement would enhance co-ordination and clarify NIGSD's mandate regarding training and indicator development vis à vis other government entities. Similarly, the NIGSD, working with CAPMAS and MPEDIC, could institutionalise co-ordination across the government and with the governorates for effective data generation, sharing and use (OECD, Forthcoming[5]).

Finally, despite its role as MPEDIC's primary service provider, the NIGSD also maintains a significant degree of operational autonomy, primarily to safeguard its institutional independence. This independence was deemed vital by consulted interlocutors to engage private institutions. To strengthen this independence at a governance level, a merit-based appointments process for the Board of Trustees would fortify the institute's independence from government influence. Moreover, the NIGSD could further negotiate at arms-length with the MPEDIC to adjust or decline requests that fall outside the scope of its mission or for which it does not have the capacity. This could help reaffirm its autonomy and ensure that it can focus its resources on priority themes as set in the mandate and mission statement. The NIGSD should also consider displaying its distinct identity as awareness of its association with MPEDIC sometimes creates confusion with potential partners. This can be done by developing a distinct brand identity, highlighting the NIGSD's unique mission and values while further communicating on its autonomy, on innovative approaches and on projects done with non-government partners (see Chapter 5).

# Developing internal cooperation and synergies for further effectiveness

The NIGSD's organisational framework is structured to address the specific dimensions of the Institute's work, namely capacity building, research, and consultancy services. Its departments are deliberately delineated to minimise overlap and prioritise co-ordination.

## Research

The NIGSD research activities are carried out by multidisciplinary teams housed within two core centres: the Governance Centre and the Sustainable Development Centre. These centres play unique roles, with a primary focus on research activities. However, the teams within these centres consist of only a handful of researchers, each contributing their expertise across various fields to support the institute's extensive research and policy analysis. Improving these capacities, by increasing the number of researchers would significantly strengthen these endeavours, better position the NIGSD in national and international research, and help structure and fuel the other activities of the NIGSD, particularly capacity building. Similarly, the INAP in Spain also leads research activities to support innovation in the public administration through several publications and a dedicated Public Innovation Laboratory, in addition to its training activities (see Box 3.3).

# Box 3.3. INAP's support for research and innovation in public administration

The INAP promotes research and analyses related to government and the different levels of public administration from an interdisciplinary perspective.

As part of these efforts, the INAP publishes three different journals: Journal of Local and Regional Government Studies (REALA); Journal of Public Policy Management and Analysis (GAPP); Journal of Administrative Documentation (DA).

Moreover, the institute aims to help public administrations adapt to change by boosting the use of technology, talent, and experiential knowledge in their processes. To this end, a Public Innovation Laboratory was established, providing a dedicated space for discussions, analysis, experimentation, and collaboration related to public policies and services. Furthermore, the Laboratory makes available to interested parties an Innovation Resource Catalogue consisting of a collection of tools available under open licences to support public entrepreneurs. These tools include, for instance, public service design toolkits with methods, models and innovation principles developed by Spanish universities such as the UOC (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya). Are also available in the Catalogue strategy guides and

The NIGSD has supported the establishment of the EEIC that works as a hub supporting the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Egypt, especially to turn youth's ideas into successful start-ups. By mission, the EEIC provides practical focus and acts as an innovation and support hub for entrepreneurs that can be very useful for young entrepreneurs and upstart-ups. Through this focus on entrepreneurship and innovation, the EEIC's work contributes to enhancing competitiveness. In line with its mandate, the EEIC does not conduct research nor supports other areas of competitiveness besides start up development. While different units contribute to work on competitiveness, the NIGSD currently has no dedicated unit nor capacities on the theme of competitiveness and its various dimensions (markets, trade, employment and skills, innovations, infrastructure, public governance, etc), and could consider developing analytical and consulting capacities on specific aspects of competitiveness. The NIGSD report on indicators could include a specific section on competitiveness indicators or could release a separate report on competitiveness indicators and analysis. In particular, the report could comment the Global Competitiveness Index that is used as a reference in Egypt Vision 2030 or Harvard's Atlas of Economic Complexity, and explore in more details indexes like the Global Sustainable Competitiveness Index than it currently does (World Economic Forum, 2020[7]) (Harvard Growth' Lab, 2023[8]). The report could also include a more detailed analysis of the drivers of competitiveness in Egypt as outlined by the indicators. One option would be to add the theme of competitiveness, as well as internal analytical capabilities, to the now Centre for Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Competitiveness.

The NIGSD's research initiatives are a core aspect of its work and contribute significantly to the development and application of governance principles in various sectors. These comprehensive research services play a significant role in advancing governance and sustainable development initiatives in Egypt:

*   The Centre of Governance, a part of the NIGSD, plays a pivotal role in creating essential documents that serve as tools for the implementation of governance principles across different sectors. These documents include Standard Operating Manuals, Manuals, Surveys, and a Governance Glossary of terms. Furthermore, the centre takes on the responsibility of periodically assessing and updating these documents to ensure their relevance and effectiveness.
*   The NIGSD issues an academic journal titled "Governance for Sustainable Development Review." This journal is designed to cater to the research community and provides valuable insights into various aspects of governance, exploring its dimensions and the impact it has on sustainable development. This academic publication contributes to the scholarly understanding of governance-related matters. The first issue of the GSDR dealt with the move to the new capital (and interrelated governance and planning dimensions supported by case studies) and the second one with environment governance and climate change, a theme also explored by the OECD through an upcoming working paper on Climate governance arrangements. Both issues involve internal experts and contributors, calling for more cooperation in the development of the GSDR (NIGSD, 2023[9]).
*   In addition to the academic journal, the NIGSD also produces various publications aimed at enhancing governance in both the private and public sectors. These publications are strategically designed to foster an environment of good governance.
*   The NIGSD's Centre of Governance offers research services in the field of governance, integrity, and related issues to governmental entities, private organisations, and non-profit organisations based on their specific requests. This service involves conducting research tailored to the unique needs and requirements of the client.

*   The NIGSD also houses a number of centres carrying out research activities in different fields, including the Cairo Centre for the Localization of the SDGs and the Egypt Impact Lab. This Lab uses cutting-edge approaches and research methods on evaluation and impact assessment in Egypt in collaboration J-PAL. This Lab has the capacity to further disseminate innovative approaches and the evaluation culture in the country.
*   The NIGSD also engages in research efforts that are intended to raise general awareness. These research initiatives, often with a special focus on governance and sustainable development, are crafted to educate the wider community and provide valuable insights on pertinent issues.
*   To communicate and disseminate their research work, NIGSD actively participates in public events, such as conferences and book fairs, and ensures that their work is available to a wider audience through their website.

## Training

The NIGSD is recognised as a pioneer in providing training in Egypt, with specialised expertise that are valued and positively assessed by recipients of training activities. A distinct Training Department, composed of 20 individuals, manages logistics and technical support for the capacity building programs. The training department typically relies on external trainers, while the number of in-house trainers is increasing, and materials for content delivery in these training sessions, with the Governance and Sustainable Development Centres occasionally developing content based on specific training demands, thereby ensuring a comprehensive approach. Training programs are typically provided upon request, but NIGSD is also prepared to deliver them when directly assigned by the NIGSD Board of Trustees or MPEDIC. For example, following an MPEDIC request, the NIGSD has recently been delivering two training programmes: “Be an Ambassador for Sustainable Development”; and the “African Women Leaders" (OECD, Forthcoming[5]). These training programmes extend beyond the institute itself, with collaborative efforts with various universities in Egypt, aiming to bolster the development of the workforce.

The public training field in Egypt is complex and involves a number of players. CAOA is leading training activities for civil servants by mandate. CAOA also plays a leading role in capacity building and training in the Egyptian institutional landscape, monitoring training needs and referring staff to various training programmes both in-house and externally. It offers in-house training through its different training centres. As such, CAOA coordinates with several public or academic institutions such as the NIGSD. Increasing co-ordination with CAOA in this area can help ensure synergies and complementarities as both organisations usually work on different themes, notwithstanding the fact that CAOA is the GoE's civil-service training/career-development arm. A more formal and codified relationship in this area between NIGSD, CAOA and MPEDIC could be of significant mutual benefit in optimising training design and delivery services aimed at civil servants at all levels of the administration. INAP's cooperation with the Spanish Ministry of Social Affairs in designing its new training strategy is an insightful example of the benefits of a close cooperation with related institutions and bodies (see Box 3.4).

Several public and academic institutions are also developing and supporting training activities in addition to CAOA and the NIGSD, including the National Anti-Corruption Academy (NTA), and local or international universities (see chapter 4). The National Training Academy established in 2017 by Presidential Decree (no. 434) is another important actor in this field. The main aim of the Academy is to develop young potentials with a wide range of training programs not only limited to individuals but also for institutions in the public and private sector. The National Anti-Corruption Academy of the ACA also aims to provide training in preventing and combating corruption and has been a partner of the NIGSD (OECD, Forthcoming[10]).

Co-ordination mechanisms such as a MoU can help formalising, developing, and codifying partnerships between the NIGSD and other key institutions. In particular, the NIGSD could partner with MPEDIC through a MoU to engage regularly with CAPMAS, SDUs and relevant governorates to identify, plan and execute

training programmes for data officers in line ministries and in the governorates. This could enhance the
data generation, collection and sharing practices across public entities (OECD, Forthcoming[5]).

# Box 3.4. Development and content of INAP's 2023-2024 training strategy

As highlighted in its 2021-2024 strategy, the INAP aims to respond to citizens' needs in an adaptive
way, consolidating itself as a reference for public administration transformation and innovation. Within
the framework of this overall strategy, INAP developed its 2023-2024 training strategy, whose main
objective is to organise training resources to contribute to the development of people and the
productivity and transformation of public administration.

All training contents and priorities have been developed in close collaboration with partner organisations
like the Ministry of Social Affairs and cover key areas such as the 2030 Agenda, equality and non-
discrimination, open government, public policy evaluation, public procurement, accessibility, data
strategy, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. These trainings can be provided in-person, in a hybrid
format or completely online and are structured around five cross-cutting competency axes:

1.  **Public administration's principles and values:** Training programmes on open government,
    equality and non-discrimination and sustainable development.
2.  **Digital skills:** Competencies that enable the safe and efficient use of information and
    communication technologies, as well as to ensure that the transformation of the working model
    in the administration is effective for the organisation and appropriate for the workers and their
    public management.
3.  **Public management and administration:** It includes competencies related to the organisation
    and execution of management and administrative operations and to the planning and
    management of human talent, applying current regulations and ensuring continuous quality and
    improvement in the cross-cutting field of public management.
4.  **Language skills:** Competencies relating to the ability of public employees to communicate in
    one or more language(s), both written and oral.
5.  **Social skills:** Competencies encompassing the ability to use knowledge and attitudes about
    society to interpret social phenomena and problems; to use moral judgement to make decisions,
    behave in certain situations and take responsibility for the choices made; to exercise actively
    and responsibly the rights and duties of public employees and to promote and safeguard those
    of citizens.

The training activities developed in the context of the 2021-2024 strategy and the annual training
programmes are subject to review and evaluation. Participants to each activity are asked to fill in a
satisfaction questionnaire, which INAP uses as a reference to measure the quality and impact of its
activities. In accordance with the commitments of the Services Charter 2022-2025, at least 90% of the
training activities must achieve an overall satisfaction score of 7 out of 10, a threshold below which
INAP must undertake a review of the design of these activities and the collaboration of the teaching
teams. The monitoring system is complemented by the qualitative information provided in the evaluation
reports of the teaching teams and the people responsible for coordinating each activity. In INAP's
annual activity results, the results of the annual programmes are reviewed through monitoring indicators
and compared with the performance of previous years.

In 2022, 260 activities were organised, for a total of 74,700 civil servants trained.

Depending on MPEDIC's agenda and priorities, specific training programs and initiatives are assigned and
funded to be delivered by the NIGSD, serving as its primary service provider. For example, in response to
MPEDIC's request, the NIGSD has successfully executed two batches of the "Be an Ambassador" Initiative
and four editions of the "African Women Leadership" Program. To further develop its activities, additional
staff, particularly senior researchers, would be beneficial. Expanding the internal team while reducing
outsourcing would also enhance the institute's capacity, considering that its mandate extends beyond
training to encompass research and consultancy services.

To ensure uniform and an efficient organisation of work its trainings are organised in the following manner:

*   **Needs assessment:** The NIGSD initiates its capacity building efforts by conducting thorough
    needs assessments. These assessments are conducted in response to requests from both
    public and private institutions. The primary objective is to guide these institutions effectively.
    The needs assessment process involves meetings with officials and interviews to
    collaboratively determine the target audience, training topics, and other relevant details.
*   **Participatory approach:** The NIGSD places a strong emphasis on the practical aspects of their
    training programs. They adopt a participatory approach, ensuring that all activities provided
    during the training are practical and focused on guiding beneficiaries on how to apply the skills
    and concepts learned in their respective workplaces.
*   **Tailored approach:** Each training program is tailored to the specific needs of the requesting
    institution. This customisation considers factors such as the target audience, the number of
    beneficiaries, their profiles, and other unique requirements. The training material and the
    selection of trainers are adjusted accordingly.
*   **Outsourced trainers:** In most cases, the NIGSD does not employ in-house trainers. Instead,
    they outsource qualified trainers, who can be practitioners, consultants, or freelancers, based
    on the specific topic and theme of the training. The outsourced trainer designs their own material
    and content, with guidance provided by the NIGSD inter alia in the form of a template. The
    institution is responsible for designing and delivering pre and post assessments in collaboration
    with the trainer. This outsourcing of expertise is a commonly used approach by the NIGSD
    which in turn make it difficult to build internal capacities, recognising this challenge the number
    of internal trainers has recently been rising. The practices of KDZ related to balancing internal
    and external staff might prove insightful (see Box 3.5).
*   **Assessment:** The NIGSD carries out assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of the training
    programs. These assessments include pre and post assessments to measure cognitive
    performance and assess the knowledge gained by participants. Additionally, assessments
    cover logistics, such as the training location, environment, catering, and overall practicality. The
    trainer's performance is also evaluated, with the expectation that trainers should receive a
    minimum rating of 85% from the beneficiaries.
*   **Annual planning:** The NIGSD plans its activities and programs for the year in advance,
    preparing an annual plan. This plan is developed six months before the start of the year and is
    closely monitored. Progress reports are submitted to the financial department every three
    months to ensure accountability and effective execution of the plan.
*   **Alignment with SDGs and Egypt's Vision 2030:** The NIGSD aligns its activities with the United
    Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Egypt's Vision 2030. This commitment
    extends to promoting gender equality, empowering youth, and supporting people with
    disabilities across all 27 governorates through the various training programs, awareness
    sessions, and activities that they deliver.

# Box 3.5. KDZ: Recruiting and balancing internal and external staff

At KDZ, the in-house team concentrates on substantive tasks, with experienced employees managing
research, consultancy and training activities, leaving the areas beyond KDZ's expertise to external
specialists. In this fashion, internal staff focus on substantive work and not just external experts'
management. For 80% of the projects, teams are proposed by area coordinators and experts, and then
approved by the managing director. In addition, the teams use a capacity-planning tool to organise the
distribution of work.

Regarding recruitment and capabilities, in-house employees are responsible for handling research,
consultancy, and training, and employees are encouraged to work on two of the methodological areas
as well as two thematic areas. In addition, KDZ often hires junior profiles, emphasising development
and learning.

Source: Author's work based on information collected during the fact-finding interviews organised in the framework of the project.

Partnerships and collaboration are also integral to the NIGSD's work. The teams at NIGSD actively engage
in partnerships with universities, often working together on collaborative training programs. On an annual
basis, the teams list their achievements and lay out plans for the following year. While internal colleagues
may give informal feedback, a structured approach seems to be lacking.

The consistency of training activities with the mandate and the alignment with the analytical work of the
institute have been diversely assessed by internal stakeholders met by the OECD. The training offered by
the NIGSD seemed to be based largely on demand and could sometimes be further assessed against the
benefits for the NIGSD to deliver those trainings in an attempt to focus its resources and efforts on themes
that are priority for the NIGSD's mandate. The systematic use of external trainers could be reconsidered
further in light of the possibility to better value internal work and to connect research and external expertise,
at least by ensuring that this expertise also benefits internally to the NIGSD work and capacities. For
instance, training and work delivered on integrity calls for increasing internal capacities to produce content
on public sector integrity that can be further disseminated in the training sessions. There seems to be
further room to align training activities with specific aspects of the mandate and to reflect the research work
and findings into the training activities currently implemented and the training portfolio.

## Consultancy

In recent times, the NIGSD has also provided consultancy services to various entities, offering insights on
corporate governance, governance roles and providing training to employees and executives. Within the
realm of sustainable development, the focus remains on training courses rather than consulting,
particularly in collaboration with universities and the implementation of programs like “Be an Ambassador
for Sustainable Development". Concrete projects and activities were nevertheless implemented with NGOs
in this field, particularly under the umbrella of the Decent Life Initiative.

## Organisational transformation

While the NIGSD has made significant efforts to adapt to its new mandate, enhance its role as a service
provider, and set internal good governance standards, it acknowledges the imperative to restructure its
internal management, organisation, and processes. The institute aims to ensure that it is fully equipped to
meet its commitments and lead by example in upholding good governance principles within its operations.
Consequently, the NIGSD Board of Trustees has sanctioned an internal reorganisation plan to facilitate
these objectives, awaiting final approval from CAOA (see Figure 3.1). The newly established Strategic

Planning Unit plays a pivotal role in this reorganisation by ensuring the strategic framework is consistently
reviewed and updated to align with the institute's evolving goals.

The institute's consulted interlocutors have also recognised the necessity for improving internal co-
ordination among different departments and enhancing the technical expertise of its staff, underlining the
ongoing focus on refining its operations and processes. KDZ's organisational chart can be of relevance for
the NIGSD internal functioning. It stresses the non-hierarchical and horizontally organised structure of the
Centre. In that context, internal staff organise themselves based on projects (rather than departments) and
are encouraged to pursue projects in two or more thematic themes, and in two or more services (i.e.,
training, consulting, and research) (see Box 3.6).

Considering the mandate and ambitions of the NIGSD, it could consider giving more visibility to the
thematic centres compared to management support functions, and possibly mentioning the EEIC and
assigning it competencies on competitiveness. The proposed structure foresees the creation of new
departments on legal and a Communication and Awareness Unit that could help further build the
capabilities of the NIGSD in these areas and support the training, consulting and research activities. In this
regard, the NIGSD could also consider expanding competencies in areas such as strategy and marketing.
The recently created Strategic Planning Unit would also further support the Executive Director in
developing strategic documents and guidance and in monitoring the progress and consistency of the work
of the NIGSD in all areas, potentially identifying gaps, bottlenecks, and opportunities. This team would also
have the capacity to screen the Egyptian institutional landscape and the global context to identify possible
new trends and areas of work to consider.

# Box 3.6. Organisational structure and functioning of KDZ

KDZ is governed by a management board that includes representatives from public institutions,
municipalities, associations, foundations, and the private sector. It also has a Scientific Board
consisting of policy and academic experts (Figure 3.2). The centre has 28 employees (of which 25 are
permanent) organised on a non-hierarchical and horizontal basis. Internal staff are structured based on
project assignments rather than departmental divisions, and they are encouraged to participate in
projects related to two or more thematic themes within the organisation's core services, which include
training, consulting, and research.

## Figure 3.2. KDZ's organisational chart

**Level 1 (Top Level):**
*   Office Management
*   Managing Directors
*   Knowledge Centre

**Level 2 (Middle Level, under Managing Directors):**
*   Public Relation
*   Chief Digital Officer

**Level 3 (Bottom Level - Thematic Area Coordination):**
*   Public Management Consulting
*   Public Finances and Federalism
*   European Governance And Urban Policies
*   CAF Centre
*   Public Sector Training

Despite the horizontal organisation of the centre, strategic decisions are taken at the level of managing
directors and coordinators. This is the case, for example, with the public relations strategy, which
focuses on social media in addition to the traditional press. In the case of the centre's marketing and
visibility, despite not having a formal strategy, meetings are organised monthly also at the level of
managing directors and area coordinators to discuss the next steps to be taken in this regard.

## Knowledge management

The topic of knowledge management is recognised as a strategic focus at the NIGSD, underpinned by a
multifaceted approach that takes into account both organisational culture and technology. The NIGSD is
currently working on a strategy for knowledge management that prioritises the incorporation of
organisational culture and people. This approach is instrumental in identifying areas of strategic importance
to the institute and nurturing a culture of knowledge-sharing. An important aspect of this is the
encouragement for individuals who undergo specific training programs to return and share their newfound
knowledge with their teams. This proactive knowledge sharing not only fosters a culture of innovation but
also leads to the creation of projects derived from said acquired knowledge. The NIGSD also incentivises
its employees to enhance their influence within the organisation by actively sharing and utilising
knowledge. This implies that employees who engage in knowledge sharing and utilise it effectively are
more likely to be nominated for further training and development courses. This approach not only enriches
individual expertise but also cultivates a collaborative learning environment within the institute. However,

| 49
it is important to recognise that this may lead to undertraining of certain individuals, so it is important to
ensure all employees are offered the same opportunities. The NIGSD could also consider further
disseminating its internal research and publications by organising internal and external dissemination
events with the authors presenting and building capacities on the reports and work released.

In parallel, the institute is also proactively exploring various technologies that can be integrated to create
an environment conducive to enhancing the impact and efficiency of knowledge management, especially
regarding training. The adoption of relevant technologies aims to streamline the processes of knowledge
acquisition, dissemination, and application. By harnessing technology, the NIGSD strives to leverage its
internal capacities to their full potential, thus furthering its mission of promoting good governance and
sustainable development in Egypt. This balanced strategy, encompassing both organisational culture and
technology, underscores NIGSD's commitment to effective knowledge management as an essential
component of its work.

# Budget
The NIGSD's budget is very dynamic and shaped by several factors. Most importantly, the NIGSD operates
as a self-funded institution (see chapter 3 discussions on budget autonomy to sustain the agency's
independence), wherein any profit generated from its services is reinvested back into the institute. The
budgetary process involves the following key elements:

*   Annually, the NIGSD develops a budget proposal. This proposal undergoes a comprehensive
    review and approval process by the Ministry of Finance (MoF), with the Minister of Planning,
    Economic Development and International Cooperation (MPEDIC) serving as the chairman of the
    board, overseeing the budgetary aspects.
*   Over the past two years, the NIGSD has experienced substantial financial growth, reported by
    consulted interlocutors at approximately 70%. While the precise nature of this growth, whether it
    results from absorption or genuine expansion, remains open to interpretation, it undeniably reflects
    the institution's financial progress.
*   It is worth noting that the support provided by development partners, including in-kind contributions
    and financial assistance from a single partner is not included in the NIGSD's official resources. This
    external support significantly bolsters the institute's capacity to deliver services and manage
    projects.
*   The NIGSD's self-funding model is highly flexible, allowing the institute to adapt swiftly to evolving
    needs and circumstances, but also making it dependent on ad hoc funded activities that might go
    beyond its mandate.
*   The NIGSD conducts regular internal budget discussions, adhering to a schedule that includes
    monthly, quarterly, and annual reviews, as mandated by law. The outcomes of these discussions
    are subsequently submitted to the Ministry of Finance.

The NIGSD's budget structure is not rigidly confined to individual pillars but instead follows a flexible
approach that can readily accommodate the ever-evolving demands of both public and private sector
clients. The budget allocation at the NIGSD is far from static, as it varies from year to year depending on
the specific needs and requests of the public sector, particularly MPEDIC. Funding agencies and
development partners also play a role, often providing financial support based on wish lists. This dynamic
approach allows the NIGSD to continually adapt and expand as the institute grows, resulting in annual
budget increases and, consequently, an uptick in profits. In all financial transactions, an overhead
percentage is applied to ensure that the NIGSD's operations remain financially sustainable. It also,
unfortunately, subjects the institute to the vagaries of project funding and to the evolving needs of existing
and prospective clients, thereby lessening its autonomous capacity to guide project selection in a way that

50 |
enables it to pursue its own strategic objectives in governance and sustainable development while
contributing to the pursuit of the government in these areas. This is discussed in Chapter 3 above.

# Overview of tailored and actionable recommendations to strengthen the internal structure and functioning

## Consider requesting an update of the mandate to reflect new roles and activities as well as the NIGSD governance, and better define interactions with key stakeholders (see Chapter 3).
*   Consider including in this update a governance assessment with the view of recommending
    options to enable the appointment process to, and composition of, the Board of Trustees to
    evolve over time so that it becomes a true strategic oversight committee that, in guiding the
    institute's growth and development, is effectively autonomous from MPEDIC and the GoE (if
    that is indeed NIGSD's strategic objective). This will help the institute to concentrate fully on key
    niche areas in governance and sustainable development of strategic importance to itself,
    MPEDIC and the GoE more generally, in accordance with its strategic planning framework (as
    recommended in Chapter 3 above).
*   Once the NIGSD has defined its strategic document and action plans, ensure that these are
    presented to the Board of Trustees for approval and ongoing supervision. This will help maintain
    alignment with the institute's strategic objectives and provide a clear roadmap for its activities.
*   Ensure that all activities and resources are aligned with the institute's mandate and strategic
    objectives. Concentrate on building activities and thus expertise and experience in key niche
    areas, avoiding spreading efforts too thinly.

## Further anchoring (with MPEDIC support) the role of the NIGSD in cross-government co-ordination and support, analysis and monitoring:
*   Actively use the Advisory Committee with MPEDIC and the MoU (see chapter 2) to develop
    active dialogue and cooperation with MPEDIC, particularly the strategic department, to discuss
    existing work and needs (research and analysis, capacity building), particularly on sustainable
    development and in support to Egypt Vision 2030.
*   Design and use one or more formal and codified co-ordination tools, using the strategic planning
    framework (with its strategic objectives) recommended in Chapter 3 to guide the NIGSD's
    partnering. For example to codify clearly in the Memoranda of Understanding with key partners
    within government, including CAPMAS and others, the priority of objectives, roles and
    responsibilities, deliverables and timelines, and resource-allocation decisions, as a means to
    pursue strategic objectives of mutual interest in governance and sustainable development,
    notably in the context of implementing Egypt Vision 2030.

## Enhance capacities by investing in additional capabilities, particularly in areas of competitiveness and in functions of strategy, legal, and marketing. This will enable the institute to operate more effectively and efficiently while expanding its impact. This can be done by:
*   Appointing leaders for these missing areas and give them adequate human and financial
    resources to build out capabilities.
*   Providing training and development opportunities for NIGSD staff to build strengthen capabilities
    in strategy, legal, and marketing.

INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT © OECD 2025

| 51
*   Assign to the strategic team/capabilities the task to develop and follow up on the mission
    statement and work plans of the NIGSD and examine and provide guidance to the management
    and to teams on the consistency of projects with the strategic objectives of the NIGSD.
*   Hiring additional personnel with expertise in these areas to complement the existing team.
*   Encourage knowledge-sharing and cross-training among staff to ensure a well-rounded skill set
    within the organisation.
*   Consider expanding the Egypt Entrepreneurship and Innovation Center into the theme of
    competitiveness with new research and analytical capabilities; or develop a separate centre or
    unit mirroring for instance the Institutional Governance Unit. Consider hiring new researcher(s)
    on the topic if missing.

## Identify the most efficient and strategic ways to deliver training and research:
*   This can be achieved by increasing the analytical capacity of the institute and strengthening the
    involvement of researchers in other activities; invest more in research and analytical capacities
    to support the NIGSD positioning and value-added on good governance, competitiveness and
    sustainable development for the government, local clients, and international partners.
*   Additionally, negotiate formal Memoranda of Understanding with relevant entities such as
    CAOA, MPEDIC, and others to optimise the design and delivery of training and research
    services at all levels of the administration.

## Further enhance knowledge management initiatives by combining cultural and technological strategies.
This holistic approach ensures the effective acquisition, dissemination, and application of knowledge,
fostering innovation and improving organizational efficiency. To achieve this, the following actionable
steps should be taken:
*   Cultivate a Culture of Knowledge Sharing by developing and implementing a comprehensive
    knowledge-sharing program that encourages individuals who undergo specific training
    programs to actively share their knowledge with their colleagues and teams.
*   Ensure that all employees have equitable access to training and development opportunities.
    Implement a system that assesses individual training needs and ensures that undertraining is
    minimised by create a transparent and fair process for nominating employees for further training
    courses.
*   Implement a digital knowledge management platform that allows for easy storage, retrieval, and
    sharing of training materials, research findings, and best practices. This platform should
    promote collaboration and accessibility for all employees.
*   Encourage cross-functional teams and joint events and presentation of knowledge produced so
    cross-pollination of ideas and expertise can lead to innovative solutions and projects.

## Stabilise the NIGSD's budgetary situation by:
*   Developing a comprehensive financial planning strategy that includes long-term financial goals,
    contingency plans, and risk mitigation measures building on the annual budget forecasting. This
    strategy should account for the potential fluctuations in project funding and the impact on
    NIGSD's budget.
*   Further investing in marketing and outreach efforts to promote services to a broader audience.
    This can involve actively engaging with potential clients and partners through conferences,
    workshops, and online platforms.
*   Exploring further opportunities to secure funding from various sources. This may include
    pursuing grants, more partnerships with international organisations, and long-term

# 4 Building partnerships with Egyptian and international stakeholders

This chapter focuses on the NIGSD's collaboration with Egyptian and
international stakeholders, highlighting the importance of strategic
partnerships in activities such as training for civil servants. It proposes
recommendations to help the NIGSD establish structured, strategic
partnerships, enhance cross-government co-ordination and improve
monitoring and evaluation of existing collaborations.

Building partnerships is an essential element of the National Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development's (NIGSD) activities. As stated in the Prime Minister Decree n°1880/2020 and in their mission statement, the institute aims to "Conduct research and statistical activities and surveys, in partnership with regional, national and international research institutions (Arab Republic of Egypt Prime Minister, 2020[1]). It also offers private and public sector training and consultancy in good governance practices, competitiveness and sustainable development, building partnerships not only with target entities but also with CSOs and academia that provide support to this end.

Following the reorganisation and revamping of the mandate and strategy to expand activities in 2018, the NIGSD has been increasingly developing national, regional and international partnerships with a large range of actors, notably governmental entities and public institutions, international and regional organisations in Egypt and abroad, private companies, national and international universities, research centres, as well as CSOs. The reinforced collaboration with stakeholders responds to three main objectives: scale up and deepen NIGSD's activities in line with their mandate to promote good governance and sustainable development in Egypt; increase the quality, reach and relevance of training, consultancy and research activities; and build their reputation as a reference actor on good governance and sustainable development at the national and international level. In this regard, the NIGSD should consider further formalising these strategic partnerships using such co-ordination tools as Memoranda of Understanding between its key partners, as it does with MPEDIC, to clearly codify the shared roles, responsibilities, deliverables and their timelines, and resource-allocation and pooling initiatives so as to facilitate the common pursuit of strategic policy objectives of mutual interest (see Chapters 3 and 4). The MoU with MPEDIC can be used as a blueprint for future partnerships.

This chapter presents an overview of the NIGSD's partnerships with Egyptian and international stakeholders. It focuses on the current characteristics of the partnerships and the existing opportunities to further deepen them, building on the impetus for more strategic engagement with partners and NIGSD's ambition to scale up outreach activities. It represents a key opportunity for the NIGSD to build capacities and resources, as well as affirm their position on the national and international stage.

# The NIGSD is expanding activities for governance for sustainable development and competitiveness

In recent years, the NIGSD has increasingly developed partnerships, in line with the expansion of their activities as a service provider. As illustrated in Table 4.1, there is a large variety of partnerships developed by the NIGSD. Partnerships take different forms depending on the profiles of the partners, their needs and the areas of cooperation identified (consultancy, training, and research), although they are all linked to the promotion of governance, sustainable development and competitiveness. Due to its position in the Egyptian institutional landscape, the NIGSD collaborates particularly closely with some key actors such as MPEDIC on a large range of topics and activities.

The scaling up and diversification of partnerships as currently undertaken by the NIGSD is key to ensure the Institute can deliver on their ambitious mandate to promote good governance and sustainable development. The NIGSD also displays prestigious and well-respected international partners which can help strengthen its credibility at the local and international level promote knowledge sharing. Moreover, as OECD studies show (OECD, 2023[2]), collaboration with stakeholders through the development of partnerships can help increase the quality and relevance of services to the needs of users and expand capacities to implement activities and deliver on priorities. It also contributes to building the institute's reputation as a reference actor on good governance and sustainable development at the national and international level. KDZ is an example of the mutual benefit that partnerships can provide at both national and international levels and could serve as a best practice inspiration for the NIGSD in its efforts to expand and deepen strategically its partnerships network (see Box 4.1). Similarly, CIFAL Flanders can be of interest for strengthening NIGSD's strategic partnerships (see Box 4.2).

## Box 4.1. KDZ has implemented several partnerships to achieve its strategic goals

For KDZ, collaborative partnerships are the backbone of a sustainable and trustful cooperation. These partners support and co-operate with KDZ in its different endeavours. An illustrative example is the centre's partnership with the Regional School of Public Administration in the Western Balkans (ResPA), with whom KDZ has been working over the last few years to establish the Western Balkans "Regional Quality Management Centre” (RQMC), inaugurated in 2022. This project is part of the BACID programme ("Building Administrative Capacities in the Danube Region"), that seeks to sustainably advance the development of public administration in the Western Balkans towards EU standards. As a member of this programme, KDZ also founded a “Network for Digitalisation” with NALAS (Network of Associations of Local Authorities of Southeast Europe) to work on measures for the digitalisation of cities and the creation of necessary standards.

Furthermore, in 2023 KDZ will be involved in two multi-lateral TSI projects supporting the Austrian ministry of arts, culture, civil service and sport as partner; as well as in the EU project Weber 3.0 on civil society monitoring of administrative reform in the Western Balkans. The centre has also developed a close partnership with the OECD, supporting SIGMA (Support for Improvement in Governance and Management) with the development of the “Principles of Public Administration” (OECD SIGMA 2017) in relation to the municipal and multi-level governance.

As the Austrian CAF centre, KDZ also has access to the German-Austrian CAF network and to the network of accredited centres. In order to broaden and deepen this collaboration with other organisations in the network, the CAF Centre opted for the digitalisation of its activities and will be able to offer most of its activities online by 2022. This included the development of the CAF digital knowledge platform, which offers access to national and international projects carried out by other accredited centres, best practices, the CAF network, and other CAF-related documents. Additionally, KDZ hosts events to bring together the EFAC practitioners' network (External CAF Feedback Experts), including the RQMC within ResPA, to exchange professional experience and strengthen practical knowledge in delivering Professional External Feedback Procedures (PEF). Among the activities that KDZ organises with external evaluators is also the organisation of qualifying training sessions for organisations that want to act as EFACs. The exchange of knowledge and experiences in this context is of relevance for KDZ, as the organisations that have applied the framework can undergo the PEF assessment carried out by EFAC practitioners to obtain the "Effective CAF user" certificate.

## Box 4.2. CIFAL Flanders is a member of several global fora and associations and has implemented partnerships also at the local level

CIFAL Flanders relies on its partnerships to achieve its expected goals, especially as 65% of its income is provided by contributions from partners. All CIFAL partners are members of the SDG Learning Network, through which they can exchange information, knowledge, and expertise about their sustainable transitions. Currently, this network includes more than 30 learning partners.

As an active networker, CIFAL Flanders is a member of several global fora and associations. It is one of the co-founders of SDSN Belgium (Sustainable Development Solutions Network), which is part of a

global SDSN network of research centres, universities, and academic institutions to promote practical
solutions for sustainable development. Members of this network collaborate to support action-oriented
research on SDGs and the Paris Climate Agreement. The institute is also a member of the UNA Belgium
(United Nations Association), and the UNCG (United Nations Communication Group) in Brussels.
Moreover, CIFAL Flanders is part of the Belgian sustainability community "The Shift", a co-organiser of
the SDG-Forum in Belgium, and a close collaborator of UNRIC (United Nations Regional Information
Centre for Western Europe).

The institute is also a member of the CIFAL Global Network which comprises 31 UNITAR-affiliated
centres worldwide, each of which is a regional hub for capacity development, bringing together public
administration, private sector and civil society. This network is an initiative of UNITAR's Decentralised
Cooperation Programme, which coordinates the activities of regional centres for trainings and
knowledge sharing. This initiative also enables the establishment of an information network for sharing
experiences among cities worldwide that have made progress in sustainable development practices
and technologies.

Furthermore, partnerships with local actors are of particular importance to CIFAL Flanders and its aim
is to "localise" the SDGs and ensure that its global training offer is relevant to local practitioners. Through
co-creation, local partners help develop locally relevant content and strategies to address different
SDGs and issues arising in different contexts.

Building such partnerships with a wide range of profiles, has already brought a clear added value to the
work and reputation of the NIGSD. First, the NIGSD has been developing a strong network of partners
both in Egypt and abroad, enabling the institute to reach out to a larger number of beneficiaries and actors
in different spheres of societies and at all levels of government. Second, the NIGSD has been able to
assimilate and leverage a high diversity of knowledge on a large range of topics linked to public and
corporate governance, competitiveness, and
sustainable development which
they could not develop internally. Such knowledge now has a decisive role to play to improve and expand
its service offer. In this sense, the installation of the Egypt Impact Lab in the premises of the NIGSD as
part of the collaboration between J-PAL Middle East and North Africa (J-PAL MENA) and the MPEDIC to
conduct impact evaluation of national initiatives can contribute to adding a scientific approach and
methodology to NIGSD's activities, that would need further exploring to mainstream impact evaluation in
NIGSD approaches. In the same way, the development of the Cairo Centre for the Localization of the
SDGs can support a more important use of quantitative analysis with regards to SDGs in the Institute's
activities.

Moreover, partnerships with CSOs such as Caritas and Helm that work on disability awareness also bring
a transversal inclusiveness expertise to the institute. The NIGSD should not only seek a closer partnership
with MPEDIC but also pursue the formalisation of the collaboration with Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)
and the National Council of Women. By interacting with CSOs in a structured manner, the NIGSD can
ensure that the needs and concerns of individuals with disabilities are integrated into their activities, a task
explicitly assigned in the organisation's mandate. Simultaneously, a strengthened connection with the
National Council of Women is equally imperative to ensure a gender lens into the NIGSD's work, as also
specified in the mandate. Through these strengthened strategic partnerships, the NIGSD can contribute
more effectively towards to a more inclusive and equitable society by addressing both disability rights and
gender equality concerns.

Finally, the NIGSD beneficiates from increased visibility and credibility on the national and international
stage thanks to the cooperation with governmental partners but also well-established and renowned

institutions (J-PAL, United Nations bodies, Hertie School of Governance, Cambridge University, etc.), on
which it could further communicate.

The broader objective of the NIGSD remains to contribute to the achievement of the Egypt's Vision 2030
and the SDGs. In this sense, forging partnerships is intended to support the impact of their work and
broaden their audience, thereby increasing the awareness and capacity of the Egyptian public
administration and society. For example, the NIGSD has initiated discussions with a large number of
private universities in Egypt with the aim of establishing a network of governance centres in the Egyptian
academic world. Similarly, the Institute of Sustainable Development and International Relations in France
has developed partnerships as well with universities, and the Institute for Research on Public Policy in
Canada with academic institutions as well as private companies (see Box 4.3).

# Box 4.3. The Institute for Research on Public Policy (Canada) and the Institute of Sustainable Development and International Relations (France) have implemented key partnerships

## The Institute of Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI, France)
IDDRI's research projects are supported by its multidisciplinary team and an extensive network of
partners that extends across France and internationally. For the various programs within the focus areas
and initiatives, in-house researchers can rely on the support of research partners who provide
assistance and financial partners to fund the activities.

IDDRI has two foundational partnerships: The Initiative for Development and Global Governance, and
Sciences Po. Since 2008, IDDRI has been in collaboration with FERDI (Foundation for Studies and
Research on International Development) through the IDGM (Initiative for Development and Global
Governance). IDDRI operates at the crossroads of prominent networks and experts in the fields of
development economics and sustainable development. This initiative, which expanded in 2011 to
include CERDI (Center for Study and Research on International Development), has been recognised
with the prestigious "Laboratoire d'excellence" (Laboratory of Excellence) designation. This recognition
was reaffirmed in 2015 through an international evaluation that emphasised the three institutions as a
French reference for their capacity to leverage scientific research excellence to contribute to
international policy discussions.

One of the most defining features of IDDRI is its close relationship with Sciences Po since 2007 in the
form of a strategic partnership. Both institutions share the same vision of the relationship between
science and politics as a key element for analysis and decision-making. IDDRI and Sciences Po aim to
ensure that the wide range of perspectives from the social sciences is reflected in their research
activities. In addition to their involvement in educational programs, the institute also engages in concrete
collaborations with several of the university's laboratories.

In addition to its foundational partnerships, IDDRI has access to an extensive network of think tanks
and influence with whom it actively collaborates for its activities. IDDRI has international and European
networks, as well as bi-lateral and thematic. In terms of its international network, IDDRI collaborates
with several think tanks located in key forums on global governance and public policies. Finally, IDDRI
is also supported by so-called scientific partners. Backed by prominent French research institutes since
its inception (CNRS, INRA, CIRAD), IDDRI is a member of influential international networks like the
Earth System Governance Network. Furthermore, IDDRI is actively fostering "multi-domestic" networks
to observe and analyse societal changes across various national contexts. These initiatives aim to
facilitate the development and strengthening of capabilities for engaging in policy discussions in diverse
countries. For instance, this is exemplified by the networks established through the DDPP and ATPI

projects focused on crafting long-term transformation strategies, specifically in the domains of energy
and agriculture.

## The Institute for Research on Public Policy (IRPP, Canada)
The IRPP relies on its extensive network of partners to carry out its research and other activities. Both
research programs and the magazine, as well as the Center of Excellence, benefit from the
collaboration of external experts who contribute to the institute's work. In fact, the think tank has a
Strategic Partnership Lead responsible for identifying and promoting partnerships and collaborations
with external organisations and the development of sponsorships. There is a wide range of different
sponsors and collaborators, ranging from multinational companies like Amazon and Accenture to
academic institutions like Carleton University and business organisations like the Business Council of
Canada.

The institute has a particularly close relationship with the federal, provincial, and municipal levels of
government, serving as a knowledge source for decision-making. For instance, following the publication
of a researcher's work on childcare, they were appointed as a member of the Early Learning and
Childcare Advisory Council. Meanwhile, another researcher was invited to the House of Commons last
year to give a presentation on their research on adult learning.

# The NIGSD has been rapidly developing its partnerships and clients focusing on one-off opportunities
In recent years, the NIGSD has been expanding their partnerships and networks of clients following two
main directions. First, an increasing number of organisations has reached out to the NIGSD directly,
especially at the national level and referring to its good reputation. It is notably the case for private sectors
entities benefiting from the institute's training and consultancy activities, as highlighted during the
exchanges with NIGSD stakeholders. Second, the NIGSD has also been initiating discussions with
potential partners identified by their business development and international cooperation department to
assess the possibility and benefits of the cooperation. The research of new partnerships led by the
Business Development department within the NIGSD is organised by geographical area (EU, United
States, Asia, MENA region, etc.). The assessments made by the NIGSD focus on the area of expertise
and past experience of the potential partners, their existing partners, their previous projects and ensuring
that their projects fit in with the NIGSD's mandate and demands.

Once contacts have been established by email, the NIGSD usually organises preparatory meetings with
potential clients and partners, where they discuss the mutuality of the partnerships. The formalisation of
partnerships can then take several forms depending on the nature, level and scope of the cooperation, as
presented in Box 4.4. For most partnerships, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is drafted between
the two entities, and later complemented by separate project contracts based on specific needs and
activities. This variety of agreements existing nevertheless provides the NIGSD with a large degree of
flexibility to adapt to changing needs and priorities of stakeholders and of the Egyptian government. The
NIGSD does not apply an annual fee for partner organisations outside of consultancy activities. Activities
taking place in the framework of other types of partnerships are funded through revenue generated by the
NIGSD's consultancy activities, MPEDIC's support to the institute and development partners' support to
programmes and initiatives, notably from private foundations. Other models exist where partner institutions
are charged an annual fee to beneficiate from services, as presented in Box 4.5.

In addition, the NIGSD has been increasingly developing work on competitiveness, particularly on
corporate governance, but has a limited portfolio of clients and partners. The expansion of activities and
research in this area could call for the search and development of new partnerships with academia, think
tanks and business development with new clients. When relevant, the scope of existing partnerships could
be further expanded to include competitiveness. These developments need to take into account the
capabilities and value-added of the NIGSD and focus on governance for competitiveness, on research on
competitiveness and the importance of sustainable development for enhanced competitiveness.

# Box 4.4. NIGSD's types of partnerships
*   Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) - they usually have a very generic structure setting the
    main framework of cooperation and are completed by specific contracts detailing activities. The
    MoUs can be signed directly with the NIGSD (e.g., CSOs and universities), or with MPEDIC
    (e.g, Ministry of Justice) where the ministry is represented by the NIGSD;
*   Protocols, that set a clear vision of the cooperation and identify obligations for each party;
*   Contracts with partners for specific activities, that can also take place in the framework of larger
    MoUs;
*   Letters of intent and twinning agreements for less structured cooperation.

NIGSD.

# Box 4.5. Partnerships modalities: the examples of CIFAL Flanders (Belgium) and KDZ (Austria)

## CIFAL-Flanders (Belgium) offers three levels of paid partnerships based on the degree of engagement
About 65% of its CIFAL Flanders income is provided by the contributions of its partners.

The institution has three levels of partnership, with annual fees ranging from 8.000 to 20.000 euros:
*   SDG partnerships: they range from one to three years, during which partners pay an annual fee
    based on the size of the organisation and receive an SDG training package tailored to their
    needs and circumstances.
*   PCA2030 trajectory partnerships: They span three years and imply a deeper degree of
    engagement. PCA stands for pioneer, champion, and ambassador, reflecting the three levels
    of ambition in the trajectory for realising the SDGs, while 2030 refers to the UN 2030 Agenda
    for Sustainable Development and the SDGs. Each phase of the trajectory requires a higher level
    of ambition in realising the SDGs: from strategic implementation (Pioneer) through transition
    (Champion) to a human rights approach of sustainable development (Ambassador). Each
    ambition level is rewarded by a UNITAR certificate of completion after an external expert jury
    judges on the fulfilment of the criteria for each phase. The trajectory is meant for all actors in
    society (governmental institutions, enterprises, higher education institutions, civil society
    organisations, etc.) and can be joined as a partner of CIFAL Flander's SDG Learning Network.
*   Strategic partnerships: The highest and most comprehensive tier of partnership. These
    collaborative arrangements typically span from three to five years and involve a deep level of
    cooperation with CIFAL Flanders. Partners at this level commit to an annual fee, support an

annual event, contribute to the foundation's equity capital, and are members of the Board of
Directors.

The institute follows a specific process for choosing its partners. For instance, potential "strategic
partners" are required to be training partners for at least three years to understand the organisation
better. An external jury then assesses the suitability of training partners to become strategic partners
based on their ambition for sustainability, ethics, and good governance, as well as their transparency.

## KDZ offers discounted services to member partners
KDZ relies on a membership system to support its activities. Unlike generic partners, members benefit
from reduced fees for services provided by KDZ, including research assignments, organisational
consultancy, and training events. In addition, members get exclusive access to the 'members' platform,
the "praxisplaner.at" tool for financial management of municipalities, a telephone information service,
as well as the journal and all other publications and documents. The Board of KDZ is responsible for
deciding on the admission of members.

There are two types of membership:
*   Institutional membership: It is targeted at public sector institutions in Europe, as well as other
    institutions that cooperate closely with the public sector. In this case, the membership fee
    depends on the size and financial resources of the institution. Once granted, the representatives
    and staff appointed by the institution have access to all services that KDZ offers to its members.
*   Personal membership: Subject to a fixed fee of 150 euros per year, it grants access to the same
    services as institutional members, except for the 'members' platform and the "praxisplanner.at"
    tool. This type of membership is open to different profiles: Managers and experts from public
    institutions, researchers and academics, people whose professional activities contribute to the
    objectives of KDZ, political officials (as long as their membership is not used for political
    purposes), and students, to whom a reduced rate of 50 euros is applied.

Sources: (KDZ, n.d.[3]); (KDZ, 2023[4]); (CIFAL, n.d.[5]); Author's notes based on information collected during a meeting organised on 26
June 2023.

Information gathered during the exchange with the NIGSD and other stakeholders suggests that NIGSD's
approach to partnerships remains as of today largely driven by opportunity rather than a formal, dedicated
partnership strategy on the long-term that would ideally flow from its strategic planning framework (see
Chapter 3), resulting in an important heterogeneity in existing partnerships. Moreover, as most
partnerships are established following direct requests to or from the NIGSD, NIGSD's activities are tailored
to the needs and characteristics of each stakeholder. This leads the NIGSD to develop consultancy,
trainings and research material and knowledge on a large variety of topics on governance and sustainable
development that are often not replicated in other partnerships, therefore limiting capacity building and
specialisation on specific topics within the NIGSD. Similarly, the objectives of the partnerships stated in
agreements vary greatly between projects, including with similar stakeholders. If some partnership
agreements mention precise outputs (e.g., number of people trained), other agreements refer more largely
to the desired impact. This can further create discrepancies of engagement with partners on the long-term.
At issue is whether the multiplication of external partnerships and clients across an ever-broader range of
policy areas is in the long-term best interest of the Institution, which runs the risk of spreading itself too
thinly and diluting its strategic focus on governance and sustainable development.

Nevertheless, there is today a strong demand from a number of NIGSD's partners to broaden the scope,
depth and length of their cooperation with the institute, notably through the scaling up existing programmes

or exploring new areas of cooperation. This is for instance the case in the framework of the partnership
between the NIGSD and the Ministry of Justice. The two institutions have launched in 2022 a large-scale
cooperation that encompasses capacity-building, support to institutional development and technical
assistance on judicial governance, that started with a pilot phase for 120 judges (Ministry of Planning and
Economic Development, 2023[14]). They recently developed a proposal for three training programmes for
3000 judges aiming at improving the governance in the judicial system as a whole to further expand their
common activities.

This impetus for deeper cooperation is an opportunity for the NIGSD to rethink their overall framework to
develop a more strategic approach to partnerships formally. This is key to build synergies between existing
and future programmes and initiatives and develop a strong network of partners supporting the institute's
activities in a coherent way to achieve their goals and priorities. The NIGSD could notably consider setting
clear/formalising objectives and rules of engagement to guide internally the review of existing partnerships
and the research and development of new partnerships and clients that would ensure a structured, uniform,
and measurable approach across partners. This would also support more clearly the pursuit of NIGSD's
key strategic objectives, while enabling the institute to contribute more effectively to the government's
implementation of Egypt Vision 2030 in these areas as it consolidates and deepens its national and
international reputation for excellence in these areas. These rules of engagement could include for
instance planning the needs in terms of partnerships (additional expertise needed, in-house resources
available, etc.) and establishing selection criteria in the annual review and research of partners based on
identified added value/ an assessment of costs vs benefits (access to a specific segment of the population,
etc,) to help the NIGSD identity the most beneficial partnerships to focus on.

The NIGSD could also develop a short reference document presenting an overview of existing
partnerships, and notably the topics covered, and examples of activities implemented. This document,
aimed at providing key information to potential partners in a short and accessible format, would support
the research of new partnerships. This document could also be made available on the NIGSD's website to
provide potential partners with a clearer vision of the support the NIGSD can provide.

Moreover, the NIGSD could also further formalise the monitoring of existing partnerships to ensure that
they contribute to reaching the institute's objectives. Currently, the NIGSD holds discussions with partners
about needs and future activities but this is not done following a formal process. Moreover, the NIGSD only
receives sporadic feedback from a small number of them on programmes implemented. The development
of action plans, regular reporting and systematic feedback on the impact and quality of activities in a more
formalised way through evaluation questionnaires for participants and regular meetings with partners or
clients could provide more detailed information on what has worked, why, and for whom. Fed back into the
decision-making and planning processes, it could further inform the planning and preparation of future
partnerships and activities and revise the course of existing ones if necessary (OECD, 2023[2]).

Some public institutions have developed strategic documents to guide the implementation of a strategic
approach to partnerships, such as the Slovak Ministry of Environment (Box 4.6).

## Box 4.6. Designing a dedicated strategy on partnerships in the Slovak Ministry of Environment
The Slovak Ministry of Environment became aware that individual departments had contractual or
informal partnerships but lacked an overall strategy on engaging and structuring these partnerships. By
making use of the Common Assessment Framework (CAF), the Ministry of Environment created a
systematic approach. Central in this approach was the necessity to achieve added value when
managing partnerships. Furthermore, new partnerships must be created intentionally and with mutual
benefits for all partners. The ministry's partnership with the Pontis Foundation serves as an excellent
example. In co-operation with the Pontis Foundation, the Ministry supports the Via Bona Award, a
designation representing a unique achievement among companies for their inspiring examples in the
field of responsible entrepreneurship and corporate philanthropy. The Ministry supports the award
ceremony and ultimately became more visible to the public, managing to disseminate the idea of an
environmentally sustainable society.

As not every partnership was deemed satisfactory, CAF helped the Ministry to identify the purpose of
each partnership. The Ministry of Environment registered more than 280 partners of various types. CAF
allowed the ministry to launch a substantive mapping of partnerships using digitalisation tools. This goal
was included in the Action Plan but intensified during the crisis when the maintenance of partnerships
became more critical. Currently, the database of partnerships is a “live database” as the process of
mapping is still in progress. The proposal of partnership management strategy includes central
administration bodies, departmental organisations of the Ministry, relevant NGOs, private clusters and
associations, partner states and their administrative bodies, higher education institutions,
representations abroad, economic mobilisation actors, and local self-government units. The current
mapping is focused on the purpose of each partnership, the beginning of the partnership, and on the
responsible person. The Ministry will evaluate the importance of the partnerships as a next step towards
future maintenance. The main ambition of the partnership management strategy proposal is to develop
a more systematic approach to partnership management.

Source: (OECD, 2023[2]).

Finally, the NIGSD could use this opportunity to offer to existing partners the opportunity to expand the
range of their cooperation, in line with their mission statement. Beyond scaling up existing programmes
and initiatives, the NIGSD could also develop larger projects encompassing different areas of work: it could
for instance provide more systematically technical assistance to support the implementation of good
governance practices within institutions they have partnerships with to provide expertise on governance
topics.

Another area to capitalise on existing partnerships could be to further develop existing and new networks
and opportunities for dialogue. The NIGSD could notably make an enhanced use of the alumni network of
participants to their programmes to gain outreach and to amplify the institute's impact and results. As of
now, the alumni networks remain coordinated on separate WhatsApp groups. Stakeholders also
mentioned the opportunity for the NIGSD to capitalise on Egypt's leading role in the MENA region and
more largely in Africa to further expand its activities at the regional level. Moreover, the NIGSD could
encourage the development of multistakeholder (academia, CSOs, public and private actors) research
networks on governance for sustainable development, in line with its objective to create a strong network
of actors on these issues in Egypt.

These developments should not prevent the NIGSD to identify and sign new partnerships depending on
its needs, but to better select new ones and assess the value added compared to existing ones and to its
objectives. To strengthen partnerships on competitiveness topics, the NIGSD could consider further

reaching out to possible partners in this area, for instance Harvard's Growth Lab, which is in charge of the
Economic Complexity Index.

# Overview of tailored and actionable recommendations to build partnerships with Egyptian and internal stakeholders
Key partners have identified added value of the NIGSD that can support the development of future
partnerships and communications processes. Those partnerships also have a positive impact on partners
and clients' activities and positioning more largely. NIGSD's key partners highlighted the following points
among the main advantages of cooperating with the institute:

*   The strategic outreach and visibility at the local, national and international level.
    Stakeholders notably underlined the facilitated access to and high level of engagement from
    Egyptian actors at all levels of government, enabling them to reach out to more participants and
    organise more activities. The access to numerous opportunities of networking was also mentioned.
*   The diversity of expertise provided, with a special attention given to key topics such as gender
    mainstreaming and inclusiveness following a transversal approach instead of sectorial logic. A
    number of stakeholders cooperating with the NIGSD in the framework of other programmes also
    mentioned having employees participating to NIGSD's training activities.
*   The professionalism, flexibility, and international dimension of the NIGSD's work model.
    Stakeholders praised the work culture of the NIGSD that seeks to take into account all
    stakeholder's consideration in designing programmes and initiatives compared to other
    governmental organisations, in line with their objective to implement a strong network and dialogue
    between civil society, private sector and government (NIGSD, 2023[15]).
*   The value for money, notably regarding consultancy and training activities for the private sector.
    According to its clients, the NIGSD offers a more competitive alternative to private consultancy
    firms in terms of price, timeliness and overall performance.

The NIGSD could capitalise on these identified strengths as part of its partnerships, outreach, and
communication strategy to promote further cooperation to current and future partners. This is also central
to raise awareness on a broader perspective about its activities among the general public. This is key to
reinforce its unique position on governance and sustainable development on the international stage and
its objective to build public value on these issues.

## Foster a formal strategic approach to partnerships on the longer term to maximise their contribution to the NIGSD's activities:
*   In the context of the NIGSD's strategic planning framework and its strategic objectives to give
    effect to its mission and mandate (see chapter 3), create a strategic document that sets clear
    objectives, expectations and rules of engagement to review annually existing partnerships and
    guide the research and development of new partnerships and clients (e.g., planning of needs
    and resources, assessment of potential partners and clients' added-value etc.) to ensure a
    structured, uniform, and measurable approach across partners and that they support the pursuit
    of NIGSD's strategic objectives on the long-term.
*   The NIGSD could also develop a short reference document presenting an overview of existing
    partnerships, and notably the topics covered, and examples of activities implemented to provide
    easily accessible information to potential partners and support the research of new partnerships.
*   On competitiveness, the NIGSD could further develop national and international partnerships to
    support its research, capacity building, and monitoring activities. The NIGSD could partner with
    the ECES in Egypt and with the WEF to support the work on the Global Competitiveness Index
    to better monitor, analyse and provide recommendations based on this Index. The NIGSD could
    also consider engaging with the Harvard Growth Lab that publishes the Economic Complexity
    Index and carries out analysis on economic complexity, diversification, and competitiveness.
*   Expand the range of activities with current partners in line with the NIGSD's mission statement
    through 1) scaling up current activities; and 2) developing larger projects encompassing different
    areas of work when the partnership is deemed successful and in line with the NIGSD objectives.
*   Reinforce the formalisation of monitoring and evaluation of existing partnerships though an
    enhanced use of consultation and evaluation mechanisms to inform the planning and
    preparation of future partnerships and activities and revise the course of existing ones if
    necessary.
*   Capitalise on existing partnerships to further develop existing and new networks and
    opportunities for dialogue in those key areas of strategic importance to NIGSD and the
    government as these relate to its mission, mandate, and eventual strategic planning framework.
    *   Encourage the development of multistakeholder research networks on governance for
        sustainable development.
    *   Build on the NIGSD's alumni network to gain outreach and promote the results of the
        institute.

Communication has a central role to play as an instrument of policymaking, service design and delivery to support and promote the overall mission, impact and goals of the National Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (NIGSD) at the national and international level and in reporting on performance and the achievement of results. Indeed, public communication, that is understood as the government function to deliver information, listen and respond to citizens in the service of the common good, can contribute to strengthening transparency and participation, thereby supporting more inclusive and responsive policies (OECD, 2021[1]). This role has been enshrined in the OECD Recommendation of the Council on Open Government (2017[2]).

Among its most important functions, communication is a primary vehicle through which stakeholders and citizens learn about policies and initiatives, who can also participate and input on matters of public interest (OECD, 2021[1]). When used effectively, communication can ensure optimal flows of data and information in a coherent manner; it also enables to reach out to an amplified audience among and across governmental institutions, other key stakeholders and in the general population to raise awareness on the importance of strategic priorities and key issues and to create alignment with, and buy-in for, such efforts (OECD, 2021[1]). Communications can also support increasing the impact of analytical work and research on the activities of public and private actors, including by influencing policymaking and business activities.

## The National Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development has been strengthening its capacities for communication

In line with the reorganisation and expansion of their activities since 2018, the NIGSD has undertaken significant efforts to expand its communication activities, with the aim of both reaching out to stakeholders to generate partnerships and activities, and raising awareness among the general public about the Institute and the topics of governance and sustainable development. The NIGSD has a Communication and Awareness Unit (Box 5.1) with a media officer and other staff members. It also outsources some activities to a media/Public Relations company. It furthermore dedicates a part of its budget for communication activities.

## Box 5.1. The NIGSD's Communication & Awareness Unit

The Communication & Awareness Unit of the NIGSD aims to be a leading centre for communication and awareness-raising on governance, sustainable development and competitiveness at the local, regional, national and international levels.

Its mission is to raise awareness and promote the values of governance, competitiveness and sustainability at the societal and institutional level; to enhance partnerships and support the integration of efforts between the public, private and civil society sectors in relation to transparency, participation, and accountability; to achieve consensus on the public interest; and to provide channels for monitoring and evaluation to raise awareness of governance competencies.

More specifically, the Unit focuses on four strategic objectives:
*   Raise public awareness of the importance of governance, competitiveness and sustainable development.
*   Communicate and cooperate with regional and international governance and competitiveness institutions.
*   Develop a comprehensive strategy aimed at systematic promotion regionally and internationally of Egypt's efforts in the field of governance, competitiveness and sustainable development.

*   Support partnerships between the public, private and civil society sectors concerned with formulating governance, competitiveness and sustainable development policies.

To achieve these objectives, the Unit uses different channels for communication and promotion activities, such as the training platform of the NIGSD and events (workshops, conferences, seminars, lectures, personal interviews, round tables, committees and working groups, and expert meetings). Regarding the format of the communication, the Unit shares mostly specialised studies, as well as statistics and data analysis.

The communication developed targets a diversity of national and international stakeholders, notably the public sector, civil society organisations, investors and private sector, media, international institutions, and more broadly citizens.

The NIGSD's communication focuses mainly on reaching out to current and potential partners and clients. The Institute relies largely on traditional press releases that are published on the Institute's and the Ministry of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation's (MPEDIC) websites¹. Available in Arabic and English, the websites provide general information about events which have been held and announcements related to new programmes and initiatives, upcoming training opportunities and learning events, and key takeaways from roundtables and sessions held in the domains of governance, competitiveness and sustainable development (NIGSD, 2023[3]). The websites also feature information on services offered and programmes led by the NIGSD. A number of publications developed in the framework of research activities, as well as the NIGSD's annual reports, are also available. As part of its efforts to strengthen its communication activities, the NIGSD is currently in the process of developing a new version of their website with the support of GIZ. The objective is to develop a one-stop shop presenting comprehensive information on all activities offered by the Institute both in Arabic and in English. The website will moreover provide key data on audience's engagement and NIGSD's outreach. The NIGSD furthermore sends formal letters to its key partners across governmental institutions to inform them about their activities. It also communicates through WhatsApp with the NIGSD's Alumni Association.

In parallel, the NIGSD has been increasing its presence on social media and publishes regular updates about its activities with the aim of targeting larger audiences. As of April 2024, the Facebook, Instagram, that are NIGSD's main social media, but also LinkedIn and Twitter accounts, reach more than 69,000 followers altogether, a significant increase from 61,000 in September 2023. The NIGSD is moreover currently developing a podcast that will be launched in the coming months. Like-minded institutions, such as the Institute for Research on Public Policy (IRPP) in Canada, the Institute of Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI) in France and the National Institute of Public Administration (INAP) in Spain, use similar channels of communication, as presented in Box 5.2. The NIGSD is further working on the development of an interactive platform to communicate with citizens on topics related to sustainability, using the open-source system RapidPro. This tool allows for managing complex interactions with individuals, disseminating polls and questionnaires and collecting data, but also organising digital campaigns through multiple channels The tool, that can be adapted for different contexts and sectors and is used by international organisations such as UNICEF, will also be offered by the NIGSD as a service for public and private sector entities, providing the NIGSD with an additional source of revenue.

## Box 5.2. Developing strong communication capacities and activities in Canada, France and Spain

### The Institute for Research on Public Policy (IRPP) in Canada employs a mix of traditional and modern media in its communication strategy to foster engagement

The IRPP has a dedicated communication team consisting of a director, a communications officer, an event planner, and a digital engagement manager. All publications of the Institute, including those from research programmes, the magazine, and the centre, are accessible from their respective websites.

Despite this being their primary channel for communication, the institute employs a mix of traditional and modern media in its communication strategy to foster engagement. Television is still an important channel for the IRPP, as was the case with the Cable Public Affairs Channel for broadcasting Policy Radar discussions, as well as weekly and monthly newsletters to inform the public about their activities. Social media plays a particularly important role as a communication channel for the Institute. Out of the 1.5 million website visits between April 2022 and March 2023, 200,000 were generated through social media. The institute is active on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and YouTube. On YouTube, they published a promotional video as part of their fiftieth-anniversary celebrations. Additionally, the Institute also uses the Apple News platform to promote its events and activities, where it had more than 170,000 views between April 2022 and March 2023.

The Policy Options magazine also releases a podcast every other Wednesday with the intention of making expert opinions on current political topics accessible to listeners. A podcast mini-series called "In/Equality" was launched in 2022 and deals with issues related to inequality in Canada. It is hosted by a political science professor from McGill University. The podcast has proven to be a successful format; 18 episodes were released in 2022-2023 and gathered over 40,000 listeners.

Finally, to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the think tank, the communication team was deeply involved in organising a gala in Montreal, attended by political figures, academics, and members of civil society. As part of the communication strategy for the anniversary, the institute hired an external design company to develop a new logo and visual branding strategy.

### The Institute of Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI, France) focuses mostly on social media and online presence

IDDRI has a communications officer who coordinates a team of four individuals dedicated exclusively to the Institute's communication. IDDRI's strategy is highly focused on its presence on social media to engage with the public. They maintain accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and YouTube, generating a significant number of visits to the website where all their publications can be accessed. Additionally, IDDRI uses the podcast format to summarise research and conclusions in projects related to its four different focus areas. This podcast, titled "Cap sur la transition," is published between two and three times a month on Spotify, Apple Music, and Google Podcasts, with episodes lasting around 10 minutes each. This format has been successful, with over 16,000 listeners over the period June 2022-June 2023 and more than 500 followers on Spotify.

Additionally, IDDRI also publishes a newsletter. Readers can sign up online and specify which of the institute's four research focus areas are of interest to them. This way, they receive only the content related to those topics, with the option to select all four and receive the complete newsletter. This format has also been receiving positive feedback. Between June 2022 and June 2023, there was an average of around 3,900 readers per week, representing a 28% increase compared to the previous year's figures.

### The Spanish National Institute of Public Administration (INAP) actively uses its website and social media accounts to communicate on its learning activities and promote community-building

The INAP has recently undertaken efforts to improve its institutional communication, notably the communication relative to the calls for its learning activities. The annual training programmes and their corresponding calls are published on the INAP website and social networks. In addition, all activities and application forms to participate in INAP learning activities are available through a unique online Training Catalogue ("course finder"), where calls are opened as the activities become available. In order to improve the communication regarding future activities, the annual training programme also contains a forecast calendar for the call for activities corresponding to each programme and strategic axis. Public employees interested in receiving updated information on calls for proposals can moreover subscribe to the newsletter "La Administración al Día" and follow INAP's accounts on Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn. Likewise, public employees who are registered in the INAP Alumni Portal can activate the alert system to receive information on future calls for activities of interest to them. Each of these alerts includes a contact email address.

INAP also organises a number of trainings and discussion events on public administration topics that are promoted on their website and social networks, and for which live broadcasts and recordings are available on their YouTube channel. Moreover, the Institute recently launched INAP Social, a social network to connect public employees with similar interests and professional experiences. Civil servants can create their own network of contacts and participate in any of the 29 different "communities”, such as the "document management" community or the one dedicated to "accessibility" for all people in public administration procedures. Through this network, public employees are also granted access to INAP's "knowledge bank", the biggest knowledge base on public administration matters in Spain.

Some departments of the NIGSD have moreover developed their own strategy and channels of communication to promote their activities. It is notably the case of the Egypt Entrepreneurship and Innovation Centre (EEIC) that was created in 2023. The Centre uses Facebook and Instagram as its two main channels for communication. Between mid-July 2023 and mid-April 2024, the Facebook account has gathered over 5,000 followers; they are mostly young people, who are the main target audience for the Centre's entrepreneurship programmes and activities. The EEIC also launched its own website in November 2023. The centre has moreover developed and launched at the beginning of 2024 an e-learning hub that provides a diverse range of workshops in Arabic and English related to entrepreneurship, innovation, and startup development.

Nevertheless, the NIGSD faces a number of challenges related to its communication and marketing. First, the existing limitation of the budget and fiscal constraints are identified by the NIGSD as one of the main challenges in implementing plans for awareness and communication campaigns. Moreover, the NIGSD's engagement on social media remains limited, hampering opportunities awareness-raising among the Egyptian society and internationally. In-presence communication activities need more development.

Since the success of the Institute's activities depends in a significant part on their ability to communicate effectively on their activities and impact, it is important that they envisage to develop a clear and coherent communication strategy. As of today, the NIGSD has started developing communication strategies for specific programmes and initiatives. This is for instance the case for the communication around Egypt Vision 2030 that is led by the Communication and Awareness Unit. The unit has developed a three-year plan for the period 2020-2023 that aimed at 1) Implementing 34 awareness campaigns to promote and strengthen the understanding of governance and Egypt Vision 2030; and 2) Carrying out public campaigns through visual and audio advertisements and talk programmes, with specific targets for each year.

Moreover, the Institute is also considering the development of an overall communication strategy for the NIGSD.

More specifically, it is essential that this communication strategy is designed and implemented following an integrated approach. Communication objectives, target audiences, timelines, budgets and channels should be defined according to existing challenges, priorities and available resources internally but also external factors (such as competitors, etc.). They should be also aligned with the overall strategic objectives laid out in the NIGSD's mandate and mission statement (OECD, 2021[1]). Moreover, it is essential that the NIGSD identifies the objectives and key messages it aims to convey, as well as the outcomes expected and evaluation indicators. It could consider objectives along the lines of promoting good governance, Sustainable Development Goals and competitiveness to civil society, private and public players to ensure they embed them in their work; displaying the impact of the NIGSD work on policymaking and business operations; reaching out to underserved parts of society to raise participation and echo the voice of civil society; or strengthening the credibility of the NIGSD to national and international partners. Finally, the NIGSD should also, from the design phase of the strategy, identify feedback and monitoring practices and mechanisms to ensure that the communication strategy can be revised and adapted throughout its implementation to ensure it achieves the objectives. This integrated approach to communication should also be promoted by the NIGSD in their training, research and consultancy activities for other institutions.

To serve their own communication strategy and to support other institutions, the NIGSD could furthermore develop practical tools - such guidelines, toolkits, checklists - on essential communication competencies that could be used by the NIGSD staff and other stakeholders to carry out communication in a more effective way. These could cover a number of topics such as audience analysis and insights; social listening and media monitoring; internal communication; campaign design and delivery, among others.

# Developing social media and inclusive communications

Online communication and social media platforms are opening vast opportunities for the NIGSD to connect and engage with a large variety of target audiences. In addition to enabling a direct and more widespread access to information, they offer new means of communication that are more participative, innovative, agile and inclusive and that can be adapted to the needs of different groups of the population, such as young people or people with disabilities, to ensure that all citizens can engage (Bellantoni and Cazenave, 2022[12]).

Investing in social media and online therefore represents a key challenge for the NIGSD, especially in light of the importance given in the NIGSD's mandate and missions to promoting inclusiveness and to reaching out to marginalised groups of society as part of good governance and sustainable development. This can support the NIGSD's in expanding its outreach and connect with new potential partners and clients. In addition, the institute can also benefit from the two-way dialogue digital technologies and social media offer to inform their service offer and activities, and further tailor them to the priorities and needs of key stakeholders and the general public (OECD, 2021[1]).

A number of OECD Member and partner countries governments have started developing and implementing innovative practices and tools to improve the accessibility and inclusiveness of their public communication on social media, such as Canada and Norway (Box 5.3). The NIGSD could develop similar tools and practices to improve its communication.

Nevertheless, it is important to note that developing inclusive and accessible communication goes beyond designing more accessible digital websites and applications. The OECD identifies a range of practices and lessons learned about accessible and inclusive public communication in OECD Member and partner countries (Bellantoni and Cazenave, 2022[12]) the NIGSD could build on to develop its communication

practices. Improving accessibility also requires institutions to better identify and understand the target audiences (through for instance audience and behavioural insights) and also engage them to support the accessibility of all communications by design, from the outset. Moreover, collaboration of public organisations with the private sector, civil society and the media, which are key partners in promoting accessibility, can also contribute to raising awareness and educating to enable the extension of accessible communication measures and initiatives to the whole of society.

As part of its mandate to promote good governance practices at the national and international level, the NIGSD could promote more broadly their adoption across public administration to enhance inclusive and accessible communication at a whole-of-government level.

**Box 5.3. Practices and tools to make content more accessible on social media: the examples of Norway and Canada**

**Norway**

In Norway, a webpage on the digital accessibility website offers advice to communicators on creating accessible content on social media. In particular, it encourages taking into account the target audience to better choose the channel through which to communicate. These recommendations also require public officials to not just publish on social media platforms, recognising that it is important to include accessible alternatives for persons with a disability. The practical advice is accompanied by examples of detailed alternative texts for certain social media posts, such as PDF documents or images, to make them accessible to persons with a disability. The Norwegian guideline also stresses the importance of enabling citizens, including those with impairments, to participate in conversations and consultations that take place on social media platforms by relaying them on government websites. In this way, users can be aware of and access messages as well as interactions taking place on other communication channels, despite potential barriers to accessibility.

**Canada**

Accessibility Standards Canada, the entity responsible for creating and setting accessibility standards within the Canadian government, has developed several guidelines to communicate in a more accessible and inclusive manner during the COVID-19 pandemic and during other crises. These provide practical advice on the effective dissemination of information through various online and offline formats. In particular, one of the guides sets out the requirements for effective communication that does not create barriers to persons with a disability on social media. The document uses pictograms and easy to-read text to provide clear and concise information. It highlights the importance of recruiting sign language interpreters for Facebook lives so that all citizens can take part in conversations with the government. Other recommendations include the use of plain language and the inclusion of links to accessible versions of content where this is not included in the publication. Finally, the guide page itself includes an accessible sign language version and a short format.

**Develop a clearly defined and integrated communication strategy to promote the NIGSD's activities and role as a key actor on governance and sustainable development and engage with a variety of stakeholders:**

*   Define communication objectives, target audiences, timelines, budgets and channels according to existing challenges, priorities and available resources internally but also external factors, in line with the overall objectives laid out in the NIGSD's mandate and mission statement; link those communications with the impact that the NIGSD would like to have on policymakers, businesses and civil society.
*   Develop practical guidelines, toolkits and checklists on essential communication competencies to carry out communication in a more effective way.
*   Foster the use of digital tools and social media to make information widely available in an accessible and inclusive way to citizens and current and future stakeholders.
*   Develop tools and practices to make communication activities more accessible from the onset, in line with NIGSD's mandate to promote inclusiveness as part of good governance practices.
*   Promote more broadly the adoption of such tools and practices across public administration to enhance inclusive and accessible communication at a whole-of-government level.

# Linking tools with the United Nations Principles of Good Governance for Sustainable Development

In line with their mandate and objectives to "disseminate sustainable knowledge, skills, and mindset aiming at developing effective, accountable systems of governance for sustainable development” (NIGSD, 2023[1]), the National Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (NIGSD) has been developing tools and contributing to key strategic documents aimed at supporting the implementation of governance, sustainable development and competitiveness principles across the public sector, but also more largely across private sector and civil society organisations (Box 6.1). These documents are often developed in cooperation, or with the support, of national and international partners, and periodically assessed and updated when necessary. For instance, the NIGSD collaborates as well with the Central Agency for Administration and Organisation (CAOA) in the development of the ethics manual and support the implementation of governance and internal audit units across ministries through Trainings of Trainers activities. On the former, CAOA alongside the NIGSD are updating the Code of Conduct and Ethics for the Civil Service (CCECS) 2023-2027 in the framework of a USAID project. The NIGSD already participated in its previous version, which was the product of a participatory process that involved academic entities through several workshops. In the current update, the NIGSD will be in charge of promoting through different channels the codes of conduct from the manual (OECD, 2024[2]).

When relevant, the documents can also be used as part of the material used by the NIGSD in the framework of their training activities. The uptake by the NIGSD and its partners of the most relevant and innovative tools on governance, competitiveness and sustainable development is a key enabler for the NIGSD to carry out its mission and to appear as a leader and expert in those fields.

The NIGSD has developed and used a certain number of tools on governance, sustainable development and competitiveness, but its approach to the development of tools remains significantly driven by requests addressed by the government and their partners on specific topics. This is also due to the limited resources available in the NIGSD and to the challenge of being able to absorb and tailor available international tools to the national context. Moreover, most tools produced by the NIGSD have not been made widely available and are only shared with involved stakeholders, while their relevance could be further promoted. In addition, these documents are usually in Arabic or in English, but not always in both languages.

The dissemination of the tools developed by the NIGSD could therefore be reinforced to support their appropriation across the public administration, and more broadly by other stakeholders. In addition to the publication of annual reports and recordings of trainings on their website, the NIGSD - in cooperation with the government - could develop additional resources, training instruments and processes for presenting their tools to the various relevant institutions such as workshops, and newsletters, among others.

The analysis of tools and documents the NIGSD developed or contributed to in recent years shows that the Institute has been building in-house knowledge and producing resources in three main governance areas: 1) awareness-raising and capacity-building on key principles and enablers of good governance; 2) public integrity and fight against corruption; and 3) inclusiveness and stakeholder engagement.

Building on existing knowledge and resources, the NIGSD could consider expanding the range of governance tools produced in these specific governance areas, and in areas more recently added to its mandate, such as competitiveness, in line with the work undertaken by the Egypt Entrepreneurship and Innovation Centre (EEIC). Such an ambition would aim both to deepen the work done in two directions: one aimed at identifying and promoting an integrated vision of the pillars and tools of good governance needed to achieve the country's strategic challenges; and the other at expanding the practical guidance to support the key phases and dimensions of sound and effective policy and decision-making in some specific areas of work.

This would also enable the NIGSD to build strong expertise on core governance topics, further contributing to assert their position as a key actor on governance and sustainable development issues. The OECD has developed and identified several guidelines and tools that the NIGSD could draw on to develop additional tools tailored to its mandate and the Egyptian context, in cooperation with other Egyptian government actors where appropriate. The following tools developed and implemented by CIFAL Flanders (Box 6.2) and KDZ (Box 6.3) might be relevant for the NIGSD, as well as a list of dedicated tools by the OECD on good governance for sustainable development in the Annex.

**Box 6.2. CIFAL Flanders pioneers a number of innovative Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-related tools and methodologies**

CIFAL Flanders has implemented innovative SDG-related tools and methodologies, such as Greencomp, the SDG Wheel, the SDG Implementation Assessment, the SDG wedding cake, the GAPFRAME normative framework, the PCA2030 trajectory and the “9 questions to become SDG-proof":

*   **Greencomp:** It is a reference framework for sustainability competences providing a common ground to learners and guidance to educators, advancing a consensual definition of what sustainability as a competence entails. It has been designed for all learners, regardless of their age, educational background, and the context in which they learn (formal or informal). It aims to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that advance environmental sustainability. The framework encompasses four interconnected competence domains: "incorporating sustainability principles", "addressing complexity within sustainability", "envisioning sustainable future scenarios", and "taking actions for sustainability".
*   **SDG Wheel:** It is a visual representation of the 17 SDGs, divided into five categories: Peace, Partnership, People, Prosperity, and Planet. It allows to illustrate the SDG implementation self-assessment known as "SDG Spiderweb" for each goal on a scale from 0 to 5. The higher the number, the closer the organisation is to a holistic sustainability vision with clear actions and Key Performance Indicators defined in the SMART objectives.
*   **SDG Implementation Assessment tool:** It allows to carry out a structured analysis of the impact of an organisation or project on the SDGs. Developed by the Gothenburg Centre for Sustainable Development, it is a self-assessment tool in which stakeholders can be included to carry out an impact analysis and discuss future actions to be taken. Concretely, the tool allows to rank the organisation or activity from -2 (negative impact) to +2 (positive impact) for each goal using the framework of the SDG Wheel. Based on the results, the organisation and stakeholders can further discuss on the way forward, with the aim of strengthening the positive impact of the project on certain goals, mitigating the negative impacts, and addressing any identified knowledge gaps.
*   **SDG wedding cake:** It is another visual representation of the SDGs, portraying them as a system of interconnected challenges, rather than individual problems to be tackled separately. This framework developed by the Stockholm Resilience centre re-structures the SDGs in a hierarchical manner, where economic growth, equity, gender, and poverty are regarded as interrelated dimensions of the same ecosystem within a stable and resilient planet.
*   **GAPFRAME normative framework:** This framework translates the SDGs into four sustainability dimensions: planet, society, economy, and governance. It comprises 24 issues and 68 underlying indicators. The 24 Challenges are assessed for 190 countries, 22 regions and the world. This tool is used by CIFAL-Flanders to address the existing challenges for the implementation of the SDGs by sector, across industries or for across firms.
*   **PCA2030 trajectory:** Among its coaching services, CIFAL Flanders offers the PCA2030 trajectory partnership. Each level of the trajectory requires a higher level of ambition in realising the SDGs. For each of the three phases, a checklist of tasks to be completed is provided to the implementing organisation. These tasks are grouped into six working areas: learning, organising, formulating, implementing, evaluating and communicating. Together with the level of ambition, the scope of impact increases during each level of the trajectory, going from internal organisation to a wider community-level impact towards supporting the SDGs on an international scale.

**Box 6.3. KDZ: Tools to assess and promote good governance**

KDZ uses various tools to assess and promote good governance. As part of its services, KDZ offers, inter alia, access to an open budget platform, an SDG Check for public investments, and, as a Common Assessment Framework (CAF)-Resource Centre, information, training, and support on the implementation of the CAF framework:
*   **Open Budget Platform:** It provides information about the financial budget, the balance sheet, and the results of the annual financial year. In addition, data from previous years is also provided, with the possibility of comparing its evolution.
*   **SDG Check for Public Investments:** KDZ developed this tool together with the Institute for Environment, Peace and Development (IUFE) and the Ecosocial Forum Vienna. This checklist ensures the application of the SDGs in municipal projects using the "planning and operation of a public kindergarten” as an example. The aim is for municipal investments to become generationally fair, socially fair, and ecologically and economically sustainable.
*   **Tools related to CAF:** KDZ provides support to organisations aiming to implement the CAF, that is a quality and performance tools for public sector organisations, with four service packages: free; starter; compact; and plus. The "CAF Free" service offers all information about CAF as well as a free initial consultation. With the "CAF Starter", KDZ provides a more comprehensive consultation of the organisation. The "CAF Compact" package offers a joint analysis between KDZ and the organisation's management team to identify the specific needs and implementation steps. Lastly, with its "CAF Plus" service, the centre offers support throughout the entire process of introducing the CAF quality management system, for the client to eventually obtain the "Effective CAF User" label.

# Developing tools to foster an integrated approach to governance to support the realisation of the Sustainable Development Goals

In recent years, the NIGSD has developed a number of documents that focus mainly on defining and framing principles and key aspects of good governance, such as a Governance Dictionary and a Glossary for Governance and Sustainable Development Terminology. Their elaboration aims at raising awareness and building a first understanding of these topics across the Egyptian public administration and more largely in all areas of society, in line with the NIGSD's mandate.

To move forward, the NIGSD could further develop resources on how to develop an integrated approach to sound governance as a driver to achieve sustainable development and the SDGs. Successfully reaching sustainable development objectives indeed requires governments to undertake significant changes in the way they make and enforce rules, how they deliver services and how they engage citizens in the decisions that matter to them, in order to handle long-term, complex and systemic challenges, and manage difficult trade-offs in order to achieve wider well-being outcomes (OECD, 2022[12]).

The development of a global framework, integrating and linking together all the fundamental elements of good governance the NIGSD already works on or could develop expertise on, would lead to a better understanding of the issues at stake in the reforms and a more coherent approach to the efforts undertaken to ensure greater impact. It would also enable the NIGSD to strengthen its analytical capabilities on a wide range of governance topics that are essential to asserting its role as a key player in good governance and sustainable development. To go further, the NIGSD could also develop guidelines to implement these principles of good governance, in line with recent requests received from Egyptian public stakeholders - such as the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood and the Egyptian Electric Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency - to develop manuals or guides to implement good governance in their workplace.

The NIGSD could build on existing frameworks for sound governance to support the formulation of such a document. The OECD Policy Framework on Sound Public Governance identifies a number of public governance building blocks presented in Figure 6.1 that are essential to support respectively the development of a new culture of governance and the effective implementation of policy and governance reforms across government towards sustainable development (OECD, 2020[13]). Governance subjects that these tools could cover include effective whole-of-government coordination across administrative silos, policy areas and levels of government; effective communications, outreach and reporting methods; robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks; evidence-based policymaking; openness and transparency, including in document-sharing and in relations with internal and external stakeholders; and managing change effectively, among others. The OECD Recommendation on Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development (2019[14]) further provides a framework for embedding sustainability considerations in each step of the policy cycle at all levels of the public administration and with key non-government stakeholders. Figure 6.2 presents the eight building blocks that can facilitate improvements in policy coherence for sustainable development and are applicable to countries regardless of their administrative and political traditions (OECD, 2018[15]). These frameworks are complemented by a guidance note (OECD, 2021[16]) and a report (OECD, 2023[17]), showcasing tools and practices that can help countries address immediate pressures while maintaining longer term global commitments. Additionally, the OECD has developed an interactive self-assessment tool that enables policymakers, practitioners and stakeholders to review their institutional mechanisms, organisational structures and policymaking processes against internationally recognised good practices on policy coherence for sustainable development, as outlined in the Recommendation (OECD, n.d.[18]).

# Box 6.4. The OECD Self-Assessment Tool on policy coherence for sustainable development

The purpose of this self-assessment tool is to enable users to review their country's institutional mechanisms, organisational structures, and policymaking processes against internationally recognised good practices on policy coherence for sustainable development. The tool is not a substitute for a comprehensive review of a country's policy coherence system, but rather a complement that aids in identifying strengths, gaps and weaknesses as a first step towards improvement, stimulating in turn an open dialogue on what changes might be needed.

The survey is structured to be anonymous and should ideally be conducted by the existing lead governmental institution or body responsible for coordinating the implementation of the SDGs. The questions cover the eight building blocks of Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. For each of the three questions per block, respondents provide their assessment on a scale from 0 to 5. The tool then visually displays the results comparing them to the average scores based on all previous responses to the survey.

The tool is currently being complemented with an Africa-specific version that also includes questions related to Agenda 2063 for Africa.

the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in July 2018 (Committee of Experts on Public Administration, 2018[19]). They address a wide range of governance challenges associated with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These principles emphasise the necessity of continuous enhancements in governance capabilities to achieve the SDGs.

# Box 6.5. The United National Principles of Effective Governance for Sustainable Development

Institutions play a crucial role in the achievement of all SDGs and targets, but public sector reforms are required, which remain a major challenge in many countries. The principles of effective governance for sustainable development are closely aligned with 62 commonly used strategies for operationalising responsive and effective governance, many of which have gained recognition and endorsement over the years in various UN forums, resolutions, and treaties. Their primary purpose is to assist interested countries, on a voluntary basis, in building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. Applying the principles and associated strategies to all public institutions can accelerate efforts to strengthen national and local governance capacities to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and related international agreements.

Moreover, the NIGSD could also build expertise and develop resources on the principles of effective governance for sustainable development that are central to its mandate. These will be further discussed below.

## Tools to promote effectiveness

Building on NIGSD's existing activities and expertise, a first building block of good governance for sustainable development that the Institute could further focus on concerns the development of transversal skills across the public sector, to build resilience in the face of a quickly evolving environment. The OECD identifies a set of skills essential to help civil servants overcome cross-cutting and global challenges presented in Box 6.6. In addition, skills in digital technology and innovation must also be developed in order to keep up with, and harness the potential of, the digital transformation and news ways of working (OECD, 2021[21]). The OECD Recommendation on Public Service Leadership and Capability (OECD,

| 87

2019[22]) further underlines the necessity to enhance particularly the skills of senior level public servants to establish resilient leadership (OECD, 2023[23]).

In this sense, the Spanish National Institute of Public Administration (INAP) is currently implementing a new training plan for civil servants on SDGs and the 2030 Agenda, in line with Spain's Action Plan for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The objective is to better integrate SDGs into public administrative activities, by providing knowledge and technical skills to civil servants (see Box 6.7). Similarly, and building on OECD standards and best practices, Poland's central government has recently launched an OECD-developed capacity-building programme, which aims at strengthening civil servants' skills to implement the SDGs in an integrated and coherent manner. The programme responds to identified challenges related to, among others, lack of knowledge about the 2030 Agenda, insufficient communication across the government, and limited insight to the information and data resources that exist on sustainable development. The capacity building programme is complemented by an online knowledge-sharing platform, where civil servants can find information that corresponds to their area of expertise as well as their level of seniority (OECD, 2023[17]).

# Box 6.6. The OECD identifies specifics skills sets that can help civil servants overcome cross-cutting and global challenges

The OECD identifies eight dimensions which generally contribute to the ability of governments to connect domestic policymaking and implementation with global and transboundary challenges.

## Functional dimensions
*   **Turning vision into plans (Strategic Vision):** identify and analyse the problem or opportunity, develop hypotheses about what the issues may be, predict the consequences of the decisions made on the specific issues and develop an implementation plan.
*   **Delivering high quality policy (Implementation and governance mechanisms):** carry out the potential solution, ideally on a small scale first, and measure the results.
*   **Measuring progress and continuously adapting to change:** continuously collect timely and quality data, study the data collected and result obtained and deploy governance mechanisms that allow for preparedness and quick adaptation.
*   **Reacting to change:** carefully assessing policy delivery and the context in which it unfolds, then adapting processes accordingly.

## Transversal dimensions related to the specific nature of SDG implementation
*   **Transversality and long-term perspective:** strengthen the ability to identify, analyse and exploit the linkages between policies across different sectors, in a long-term perspective that allows for both resilience and sustainability.
*   **Involving stakeholders and promoting dialogue:** proactively seek contributions and feedback from citizens, private sector, civil society and competence providers.
*   **Holistic, value-based leadership:** promote inclusive, transparent management processes that can increase efficiency and accountability of public service.
*   **A culture of evidence:** formulate and adapt policies on the basis of factual information and knowledge, as opposed to ideology or inertia. This implies the ability to read, interpret, and effectively use data.

# Box 6.7. The Spanish National Institute of Public Administration (INAP)'s training plan on SDGs and the 2030 Agenda

In line with their latest training strategy (2021-2024) and the Action Plan for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda adopted by the Spanish government in 2018 to develop "a public service with the knowledge and capabilities to implement the SDGs", the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda are integrated in the training programmes of the INAP.

To go further, the INAP has moreover developed its specific plan on SDGs and the 2030 Agenda.

## Development of the training plan

To develop the training plan, the INAP received the support of the Secretary of State for the 2030 Agenda, in addition to the inputs of training officials from different levels of the State administration. The INAP first organised a meeting in November 2021 with training officials from regional and local institutions, during which a "needs map" was developed. In March 2022, a second event was organised with representatives from line ministries and the general State administration. These meetings allowed for the development of key training plan contents, with three cross-cutting criteria: practical application, workplace focus, and the creation of informal learning networks.

The training plan aims to integrate the 2030 Agenda into administrative activities, providing technical tools to personnel to contribute to the Agenda's objectives and goals. The activities foreseen in this Plan will be developed progressively between 2022 and 2025 and will be specified in the successive annual INAP training plans and the corresponding calls for proposals. As with all training sessions, once completed, a follow-up will be carried out to evaluate the satisfaction and gather feedback from the participants.

## Detail of the activities

All activities are expected to start in the first two years of the plan, which is structured into two types of training actions: 1) basic, that facilitate the acquisition of conceptual foundations and the development of essential competences; and 2) specific, which allow for the development of competencies related to the performance of concrete functions or jobs. In general, basic activities take place online, in "tutored" sessions (with a trainer providing guidance on the content), or "dynamic" sessions (in which collaboration between participants is encouraged). On the other hand, specific activities are usually developed in a hybrid way, with participants in person at the INAP training centre.

The training calendar for the period 2022-2025 was initially planned as follows:

**Starting in the first semester of 2022:**
*   **Advancing SDGs in local governments (basic):** This first training addresses the content, challenges, and opportunities of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs in the context of local public policies. Learning objectives include critically analysing the challenges faced by local governments in achieving the SDGs and strategically applying local tools, such as public procurement and plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

**Starting in the second semester of 2022:**
*   **The 2030 Agenda and SDGs in Public Administration (basic):** Participants, upon completion of this activity, will be able to identify how to contribute to transformation processes from

their organisation and synthesise what the 2030 Agenda and SDGs are, using specific tools for the application of their principles.
*   Budgeting for sustainable development (specific): This activity targets employees involved in planning and budget management. Participants will learn to comply with regulations regarding alignment with the 2030 Agenda as a criterion for budget prioritisation. They will also be instructed in the implementation of regulations on ministerial reports and the contribution of spending programmes to the SDGs. Additionally, they will learn to align spending programmes with the goals of the 2030 Agenda.

# Starting in the first semester of 2023:

*   Local Administration in the face of environmental sustainability (specific): This activity, aimed at employees of local administrations, aims to train them to recognise the localisation functions of the SDGs assigned to local entities in environmental issues. Participants will also understand their crucial role in combating ecological degradation and climate change. Furthermore, they will be able to identify tools and avenues for participation in sustainable development within the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces (FEMP).
*   Regulatory impact assessment on SDGs (specific): The training activity focuses on familiarising public employees with the techniques of Regulatory Impact Analysis Memos (MAIN) and their impact on the SDGs.
*   Policy coherence for sustainable development (specific): In line with SDG 17.14 (Policy coherence for sustainable development), this activity is organised for officials with planning and public policy development functions. Participants are expected to learn how to incorporate the OECD Framework for Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development into the design of public policies.

# Starting in the second semester of 2023:

*   Transforming Public Administrations to achieve the SDGs (basic): Participants will learn to: 1) understand and critically evaluate the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda in the context of public policies in Spain; 2) apply existing tools for integrating the SDGs into the framework of public policies; and 3) understand and assess the challenges and strategic options of institutions when implementing an SDG strategy.
*   Planning and designing public policies for the SDGs (basic): Through this training, participants will be able to understand the basic features of the SDG Accelerator and Bottleneck Assessment tool. They will also learn to align the planning and development of public policies with the SDGs in a systematic and coherent manner.
*   Creating indicators and assessing their fulfillment (basic): Upon completion, participants will be able to apply the Global Indicator Framework for Monitoring the 2030 Sustainable Development Strategy. They will also develop techniques for the implementation of these monitoring and evaluation indicators in their respective organisations.

Note: The SDG Accelerator and Bottleneck Assessment tool (ABA) is a tool developed by the UNDP as a way to support countries to identify catalytic policy and/or programme areas or 'accelerators' that can trigger positive multiplier effects across the SDGs and targets, and solutions to bottlenecks that impede the optimal performance of the interventions that enable the identified accelerators.

Moreover, the NIGSD highlighted its ambition to explore and develop innovative products as a driver for good governance (2023[1]). A systemic approach to innovation, as an embedded capability across the functions and mechanisms of government (Kaur et al., 2022[30]), is a key driver for the implementation of good governance. It enables governments and public administrations to develop the tools and capacities to adapt to rapidly changing environments and issues, while steering the machinery of government to coordinate and deliver on long-term priorities, including SDGs.

In line with their mandate, the NIGSD could therefore further promote innovation in governance tools and practices, with a focus on reinforcing agility and the forward-looking nature of governance practices (OECD, 2020[13]). This could notably involve the development of new decision-making formats, such as internal and external working groups and task forces, but also the use of tools such as results frameworks, communities of practice, innovation labs, toolkits, and implementation guidance documents. The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation has been developing a number of guidelines the NIGSD could build on to foster innovation across their partners and clients (Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, n.d.[31]). In the framework of this focus on innovation, the NIGSD could also support the different steps of the digital transformation of institutions, from designing a digital strategy to implementing tools and training people to use them. The digital government approach illustrated by the OECD Digital Government Policy Framework (2020[32]) sets a new way of thinking, approaching, engineering, and transforming the design and delivery of public services. This change involves creating a culture that is digital by design¹, data-driven and yet also operating as a platform, open by default, user-driven and proactive.

Finally, beyond developing resources for a comprehensive framework for sound governance, the NIGSD could also add to its existing toolkit a suit of practical “how-to" manuals and other instruments, including training modules, directed at civil servants notably but not exclusively at the senior civil service, that address key governance issues of critical importance to pursuing good governance and sustainable development to support the government's efforts in implementing Egypt Vision 2030, the Public Administration Reform Plan (PARP) and other core strategies.

## Tools to promote accountability
The NIGSD has been contributing to the preparation of key documents on public integrity and the fight against corruption for the Egyptian public sector. It notably participated in the elaboration of the CCECS for 2019-2022 and 2023-2027, which was developed following a participatory approach involving stakeholders from the civil society and academia. The institute is also currently contributing to the update of the CCECS with the Administrative Control Authority (ACA) under the lead of the Central Agency for Organisation and Administration (CAOA); it will then oversee its promotion across the Egyptian public administration. The NIGSD has also participated to the elaboration of the Egyptian National Anti-Corruption Strategy 2019-2022 (Arab Republic of Egypt, 2022[33]) and 2023-2030. Finally, the NIGSD developed a training curriculum on anti-corruption, with the support of GIZ, and is currently drafting a code of ethics for non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

Although the work undertaken so far on these issues has been mainly driven by requests made to the NIGSD, this could be an opportunity for the Institute to capitalise on the expertise acquired to further develop this area of work. The NIGSD could first expand the range of tools contributing to develop a culture of integrity as well as a coherent and comprehensive integrity systems across the public sector and partner institutions. The OECD Recommendation of the Council on Public Integrity (2017[34]) highlights the importance of developing guidance and trainings to equip public officials with the knowledge and skills needed to manage integrity issues appropriately. It also emphasises the necessity to develop formal reporting mechanisms that encourage and protect reporting of public integrity violations and misconduct, notably through whistleblowing practices. The OECD Public Integrity Handbook (2020[35]) provides concrete advice to implement such mechanisms and practices, building on good practices from OECD Member countries (see Box 6.8). Box 6.9 presents examples of tools and methods developed by Austria

and the United States to train public servants on public integrity, that the NIGSD could adapt to the Egyptian context.

# Box 6.8. The OECD Public Integrity Handbook
The OECD Public Integrity Handbook is a comprehensive guide that emphasises the critical role of integrity in political, economic, and social structures, making it a cornerstone of good governance. It acknowledges that integrity violations can occur across all levels and branches of government, necessitating a whole-of-society and whole-of-government approach. The handbook is built upon the OECD Recommendation on Public Integrity (2017[34]), serving as a blueprint for implementing this approach and includes the following elements:

1.  **Commitment:** Emphasises the importance of demonstrating political and senior management commitment to integrity. It outlines elements such as codifying standards, serving the public interest, and preventing conflicts of interest. It also underscores the need for high-level collaboration with key stakeholders for long-term reforms.
2.  **Responsibilities:** Provides guidance for enhancing cooperation among public organisations, addressing challenges like entrenched silos and competition. Suggested tools include memoranda of understanding and interoperable databases to improve sharing and learning.
3.  **Strategy:** Identifies steps for developing an evidence-based, strategic approach to mitigate public integrity risks, particularly corruption. It underscores problem analysis, action plans, and clear responsibility for implementation and impact measurement.
4.  **Standards:** Clarifies how governments can set high standards of conduct that prioritise the public interest and adhere to public sector values. It discusses integrity standards in administrative law, civil law, and criminal law, covering areas like freedom of information, political financing, and bribery.
5.  **Whole-of-Society:** Highlights the importance of engaging companies, civil society organizations, and individuals in promoting a culture of integrity. It discusses the balance between sanctions and incentives and practical activities like monitoring public procurement to promote youth commitment to integrity.
6.  **Leadership:** Identifies measures to attract, select, and promote integrity leadership within public organisations, emphasizing the incorporation of integrity into competency frameworks and performance agreements.
7.  **Merit-based:** Recognises the role of a merit-based system in ensuring public integrity and provides guidance on transparency and objectivity in human resource management.
8.  **Capacity:** Clarifies how to build knowledge, skills, and commitment for public integrity through training and integrity advisory functions.
9.  **Openness:** Discusses measures to promote an open organisational culture, including training for leaders on giving constructive feedback and managing conflicts. It emphasises whistleblower protection.
10. **Risk Management:** Explains the application of a risk management approach in an integrity system, including identifying and responding to integrity risks.
11. **Enforcement:** Provides guidance on ensuring a coherent approach across disciplinary, civil, and criminal enforcement regimes to enforce public integrity standards.
12. **Oversight:** Demonstrates how external oversight bodies and regulatory enforcement agencies strengthen accountability and organisational learning.

# Box 6.9. Delivering public integrity training in Austria and the United States
Values-based training focuses on developing attitudes and behaviours in response to potential integrity issues that will occur as public officials carry out their duties. It can be delivered through interactive forms, including case studies, simulation games, card or board games, and role-playing.

## United States
The United States Office of Government Ethics (OGE) used the first of three "train-the-trainer" sessions of a massive open online course (MOOC) to introduce the statute and regulations of post government employment restrictions. The course was complemented by values-based scenarios and exercises for participants to perform as if they were confronted with real ethical dilemmas.

## Austria
The Federal Ministry of Interior uses an interactive game called "Fit 4 Compliance – Find Your Values" to discuss personal values and how public service values may guide public officials in addressing difficult situations and handling ethical dilemmas. Such interactive and situational methods are used to challenge trainees and allow them to reflect on key dilemmas, as well as on the consequences of a lack of or breaches to integrity; a debriefing follows the experience.

Source: (OECD, 2020[35]).

## Tools to promote inclusiveness
As already highlighted in previous chapters, the advancement of inclusion and diversity in Egyptian society and more broadly is a key element of NIGSD's mandate (NIGSD, 2023[1]). The NIGSD works notably on women and youth and children empowerment, and also conducts training programmes on disability awareness.

Promoting the inclusiveness of actions and policies, as well as ensuring participation of all actors to their design and delivery, is therefore a second block for good governance for sustainable development the NIGSD could further explore and reinforce. Delivering results for all groups in societies calls for governments and other actors to take into consideration the needs and voices of all groups in society in policy- and decision-making processes, in particular of those traditionally underrepresented. This can support responsive policies and services, re-build their trust in governments and ensure societal resilience to complex challenges (OECD, 2020[13]).

The OECD Recommendation of the Council on Open Government (2017[36]) and Recommendation on Regulatory Policy and Governance (2012[37]) highlight the need for governments to reach out through specific actions and means to the most relevant, vulnerable, underrepresented, or marginalised groups in society, take into account their aspirations and needs and involve them in policy- and decision-making.

INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT © OECD 2025

| 93
The OECD Recommendation on Gender Equality in Public Life (2016[38]) and Recommendation on Creating Better Opportunities for Young People (2022[39]) provide more specifically guidance on how to ensure inclusive policy outcomes for women and young people.

To further develop their capacities on these topics, the NIGSD could consider developing guidance to proactively mainstream the needs of underrepresented groups into different aspects of policy and decision-making. This could for instance concerns the development and implementation of a comprehensive approach to inclusiveness across the public administration or a private institution. The Institute could also more specifically focus on the integration of specific groups considerations across government processes and actions, such as regulations, procurement, communication, decision-making and delivery. For instance, an increasing number of OECD Member countries are developing toolkits and guidelines to conduct gender impact assessments and "youth checks" as a tool to help analyse policy or funding decisions throughout their lifecycle, in order to identify and assess (potential or actual) gender or youth-specific impacts (OECD, 2021[40]; OECD, 2022[41]). The examples of Canada's gender impact assessment and Germany's youth check are presented in Box 6.10. Moreover, a number of governments have started developing and implementing innovative practices and tools to improve the accessibility and inclusiveness of their public communication for all groups in society, including people with disabilities (see chapter 5).

# Box 6.10. OECD Member countries are developing tools to support the implementation of specific groups considerations into policymaking

## Canada's guidance tool for integrating the "Gender-based analysis plus” (GBA Plus) into every stage of governmental evaluations
The Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada, in consultation with Women and Gender Equality Canada, developed a primer with advice for evaluators, on how to integrate "GBA Plus” into every stage of the government's evaluations in order to support commitments and directions. It outlines a list of questions that policymakers can use across the stages of evaluation to integrate GBA Plus, depending on the nature of the policy, programme or service, and on the type of evaluation. These are oriented along the following areas:

*   Reviewing the logic model and theory of change (e.g., do any aspects of the policy, programme or initiative have potential gender considerations?)
*   Performance measures (e.g., are there potential biases in the way current indicators are framed?)
*   Relevance (e.g., is the policy, programme or service equally relevant to different target population groups?)
*   Design and Delivery (e.g., are there particular target population groups that are not being reached with this policy, programme or service?)
*   Effectiveness (e.g., have outcomes differed across diverse target population groups? What accounts for the differences?)
*   Efficiency (e.g., what are the administrative costs of the policy, programme, or service for each target population group?)

## The use of youth checks in Germany
The youth check (Jugendcheck) acknowledges that the life situation and participation of present and coming youth generations should be considered in all political, legislative and administrative actions of the Federal Ministries. It is considered to be an instrument to support the implementation of the National Youth Strategy and a lens through which other relevant strategies (e.g. on demography and sustainability) should be regarded. Along 10-15 questions (e.g. Does the action increase or alter the

participation of young people to social benefits?) and three central test criteria (e.g. access to resources and possibilities for youth to participate), it anticipates the expected impact of new legislation on young people aged 0-27.
Source: (OECD, 2023 [42]; OECD, 2022[41]).

The NIGSD could build more largely on OECD instruments, such as the Toolkit for Mainstreaming and Implementing Gender Equality (OECD, 2023 [42]), the Youth Policy Toolkit (OECD, 2024[43]), or the panorama of practices from OECD Member countries on accessible and inclusive public communication (Bellantoni and Cazenave, 2022[44]) to promote such practices across Egyptian actors.

Another key element of inclusive governance that the NIGSD could further work on beyond their focus on citizen charters is stakeholder participation. OECD instruments underline the importance of providing stakeholders with opportunities to engage in policy- and decision-making: this contributes to more efficient use of public resources and more responsive and evidence-based regulations, policies and services, for example through consulting citizens for the identification of their needs. It also increases government inclusiveness and the accountability of decisions (OECD, 2020[13]).

Building on principles highlighted by the OECD in the Recommendation of the Council on Open Government (2017 [36]), Recommendation on Regulatory Policy and Governance (2012[37]), Recommendation on Budgetary Governance (2015[45]) but also the Recommendation on Digital Government Strategies (2014[46]), the NIGSD could promote the development and institutionalisation of innovative strategies and mechanisms for citizen and stakeholder participation in all aspects of decision-making, capitalising also on the opportunities provided by digital tools. In line with existing initiatives to strengthen the use of participatory budgeting led by the Ministry of Finances (OECD, 2024[2]), the NIGSD could for instance develop guidelines to implement participatory budgeting initiatives at the local and national level. The OECD Guidelines for Citizen Participation Processes (2022[47]) provide comprehensive guidance and tools for any individual or organisation interested in designing, planning, and implementing a citizen participation process, such as policymakers, practitioners, as well as civil society organisations, citizens, the private sector, or academia (see Box 6.11).

## Box 6.11. The OECD Guidelines for Citizen Participation Processes
The OECD Guidelines for Citizen Participation Processes provide a framework for designing, planning, implementing, and evaluating effective citizen participation processes. These guidelines are intended for any individual or organization interested in promoting inclusive governance and decision-making. Citizen participation can be beneficial in addressing various policy areas, such as climate change, public health, infrastructure, and social inequality.

The guidelines outline ten steps for a successful citizen participation process:

1. Identify the problem: Determine if there is a genuine problem that the public can help solve. Define and frame the problem as a question or issue.
2. Clarify the expected outcomes: Before involving citizens, have a clear understanding of the desired results of the process. This will help in defining the inputs or contributions from citizens and their impact on the final decision.
3. Select the appropriate method: Choose the most suitable method for involving citizens, such as information and data sharing, open meetings, public consultations, open innovation, citizen science, civic monitoring, participatory budgeting, or representative deliberative processes.
4. Design the process: Develop a detailed plan for the citizen participation process, including the timeline, resources, and responsibilities of all stakeholders.
5. Recruit participants: Ensure the diversity and representativeness of the participants to achieve a balanced and inclusive process.
6. Prepare participants: Provide the necessary information, resources, and training to enable participants to contribute effectively.
7. Facilitate the process: Create a supportive and inclusive environment for participation so participants can engage in meaningful discussions and decision-making.
8. Analyse and synthesise the inputs: Collect, analyse, and synthesise the inputs from citizens to inform the decision-making process.
9. Communicate the results: Share the outcomes of the citizen participation process with the participants and the wider public to maintain transparency and accountability.
10. Evaluate and learn: Assess the effectiveness of the citizen participation process and identify areas for improvement in future initiatives.

The methods of citizen participation outlined in these guidelines rely on principles of good practice to ensure their quality: clarity and impact, commitment and accountability, transparency, inclusiveness and accessibility, integrity, privacy, information, resources, and evaluation.

## Supporting public administration in assessing their progress toward sustainable development and the achievement of SDGs
Finally, in line with their mandate and building on their existing work and expertise, including the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) manual developed in cooperation with the Hertie School of Governance, the NIGSD could also further develop resources aimed more specifically at enabling public administrations to assess their progress towards achieving good governance for sustainable development. KDZ uses for instance the European Common Assessment Framework (CAF) for better quality in Public Administration to assess governance levels across its partners, as presented in Box 6.12.

INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT © OECD 2025

## Box 6.12. KDZ uses the Common Assessment Framework (CAF) model to support partner organisations assess their governance level
The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) model is a quality management tool developed to self-evaluate organisational operations and performance. It has been embedded in public administrations in EU Member States for more than 20 years and is a model applicable to all types of public sector organisations. More than 2,000 CAF users are registered in the European Institute of Public Administration database, representing a wide range of diverse public sector organisations.

The CAF model has nine criteria that define modern public management and good governance. Five enabler criteria create the conditions for a high performing public administration: Leadership, strategy and planning, people, partnerships and resources, and processes. The resting four are result criteria assessing the performance and impact of the organisation: Citizen/Customer-oriented results, employee results, social responsibility results, and key performance results.

KDZ offers four service packages to support the implementation of the CAF framework with the aim to improve public sector organisations and promote good governance through self-assessment: Free, Starter, Compact and Plus. The "CAF Free" service offers all information about CAF as well as a free initial consultation. With the "CAF Starter", KDZ provides a more comprehensive consultation of the organisation. The "CAF Compact" package offers a joint analysis between KDZ and the organisation's management team to identify the specific needs and implementation steps. Lastly, with its "CAF Plus" service, the centre offers support throughout the entire process of introducing the CAF quality management system, for the client to eventually obtain the "Effective CAF User" label.

Quality management using the CAF follows the principle of self-assessment by management and employees. First, the assessment form is customised to the organisation to create a common understanding of the assessment criteria. After designing the questionnaire, the organisation's assessment team is trained, and a link to the CAF online tool is provided for a step-by-step assessment. Using this questionnaire, employees and managers evaluate their organisation and collaboratively identify strengths and areas for improvement. Following the self-assessment, the results are discussed in a consensus workshop, and the assessment team determines actions. Once the discussion concludes, an action plan workshop is conducted to transform these measures into specific project plans, allocate responsibilities, and solidify the process. Lastly, a final report summarising the outcomes of the consensus workshop and the action plan workshop, including all developed measures and implementation plans, is made accessible.

Organisations which implemented the CAF can apply for the "Effective CAF User" certificate through the CAF centre of KDZ between six and twelve months after doing a self-assessment and a report on it has been delivered. In order to obtain the label, the organisation undergoes a “Procedure for External Feedback" (PEF) which relates not only to the self-assessment process but also to the way forward chosen by organisations to reach excellence in the long run. KDZ handles the application, managing the PEF process on behalf of the organisation and assembling the team of CAF External Feedback Actors (CAF) who carry out the external evaluation which eventually leads to awarding the organisation with the certificate. The external feedback and evaluation rely on three pillars: self-assessment, the process of improvement actions, and the Total Quality Management (TQM) maturity of the organisation (i.e., an evaluation of the extent to which the organisation has succeeded in implementing holistic quality development values through the self-assessment and improvement process).

# Supporting better evidence-based analysis on sustainable development

## The NIGSD is leading efforts to benchmark Egypt's governance performance against international standards and indicators
Based on the decision of the Council of Ministers on August 12th, 2020, the NIGSD is entitled to "monitor and follow up Egypt national and international classification in sustainable development and competitiveness and governance". Also, by mandate, the NIGSD is "responsible for setting national strategy and action plan in co-ordination with different Government of Egypt's agencies".

In light of this mandate, the NIGSD, through its Sustainable Development Centre and Governance Centre, tracks, analyses and assesses Egypt's performance concerning the national and international sustainable developments, governance and competitiveness indicators. Reports are performed in order to follow-up this performance, assess Egypt's efforts towards achieving the SDGs and Sustainable Development Strategy: Egypt Vision 2030 (SDS) as well as determine the related challenges. In turn, to support Egyptian policymakers, recommendations concerning these areas are delivered to the Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation (MPEDIC). In addition, innovative and effective solutions are delivered to MPEDIC to be considered while designing the SDS. For example, the updated draft of the Egypt Vision 2030 strategy was presented to the NIGSD to get feedback on it in light of the society dialogue.

While it is not currently leading monitoring activities in the Egyptian institutional landscape, the NIGSD could leverage the MPEDIC's role on strategic planning to contribute and benefit from strategic partnerships to collect, analyse and monitor data on SDS, competitiveness and governance. The NIGSD could have access to all actors working on sustainable development and working on Egypt Vision 2030 through the work and activities of the MPEDIC, and work in close collaboration with them on the analysis of indicators or topics in their sphere.

Furthermore, given that the Ministry of Finances (MoF) is working to ensure that all ministries eventually adopt performance-based budgeting practices as they adjust and align ministry strategies and their indicators with the Egypt Vision 2030 strategy and indicator framework, the NIGSD has the opportunity to lead innovative indicator work, perhaps in partnership with the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics (CAPMAS), the MPEDIC, and the MoF, that could aim to ensure that Egypt can eventually measure effectively the impact of spending performance on the pursuit of the SDGs as presented in Egypt Vision 2030. This could have the potential of enabling Egypt to contribute meaningfully to advancing knowledge and expertise in an area that represents a strategic priority for all countries engaged in implementing the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

## Focusing on a limited number of international indicators in relation to Egypt Vision 2030
The NIGSD publishes an annual summary report on Egypt's position on key international governance indicators. The main objective is to monitor and analyse Egypt's current situation and its progress in several governance and competitiveness indicators. In 2023, the NIGSD issued the annual report on "Egypt's Classification in The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) 2022/2023" to track changes in Egypt's status and relative position on a broad range of indicators. It aims to enhance its global competitiveness, good governance practices and sustainable development outputs. Additionally, the NIGSD is developing a new Egyptian Governance Indicator that is based on scientific methodologies and on international and national indicators. However, the NIGSD highlighted difficulties in data-sharing across institutions, that hamper their work on governance indicators.

To allocate efficiently resources, the NIGSD could focus on a limited set of international indicators that are linked to Egypt's strategic priorities. The annual summary should not provide a state of the art on all possible indicators, but rather focus on those that are strategically linked to the country and Institute's

priorities. In addition, if the Institute aims to develop a governance indicator, it should be part of SDG16 and Egypt Vision 2030 indicators. In this fashion, NIGSD indicators need to be aligned with the Vision 2030 and the SDGs, as well as be plugged in CAPMAS. The report could then further analyse Egypt's results and drivers in this report, and possibly connect with the authors to explore the issues and the reasons behind the ranking.

Finally, while the NIGSD could focus its analysis on more selected governance indicators, the NIGSD could also consider expanding the monitoring of indicators and indexes related to competitiveness. The choice of these indicators needs to be aligned with Egypt Vision 2030, another area of collaboration with the MPEDIC. The NIGSD could compile the Global Sustainable Competitiveness Index, the Global Competitiveness Index, the Economic Complexity Indexes and potentially others as needed. The NIGSD could also for instance support the development of the competitiveness index between Egyptian governorates mentioned in Egypt Vision 2030 (Egypt's Ministry of Economic Development and Planning, 2023[49]).

In this connection, the NIGSD should work with CAPMAS, MPEDIC and other actors already engaged in this area to coordinate more closely so that roles, responsibilities and capacity-sharing are agreed, and clear for all. As a research institute and through its work on indicators, it is crucial for the NIGSD to have access to the latest and most comprehensive datasets that can support its work on public governance, SDGs and competitiveness, especially if the NIGSD wants to provide more analytical work to support the implementation of Egypt Vision 2030.

# Overview of tailored and actionable recommendations to strengthen dedicated tools for fostering good governance for sustainable development

Consider developing tools and how-to on good governance in line with OECD standards and good practices:
*   Map the existing tools and guidelines used by the NIGSD against the activities and objectives of the mission statement and the mandate.
*   Identify additional ones that can be incorporated in the NIGSD work on new topics or to strengthen the work on existing themes.
*   Expand internal capabilities to use these tools for future analysis and projects.

Further disseminate the tools on governance and sustainable development developed by the NIGSD across public administration and other stakeholders.
*   Organise workshops and other activities to present the tools to the various administrations and departments concerned; support these presentations with training activities.
*   When possible and relevant, publish tools and documents developed on the NIGSD website both in Arabic and in English.

Expand the range of tools on key topics of good governance for sustainable development and competitiveness developed, in line with the NIGSD's mandate and international principles, building on NIGSD's existing resources and OECD instruments and guidance. The tools could notably focus on:
*   Developing an integrated approach to governance to support the achievement of SDGs.
*   Some specific building blocks of good governance for sustainable development (skills for civil servants, cooperation, innovation).
*   Inclusiveness and citizen & stakeholder participation.

*   Public integrity and anti-corruption.
*   Competitiveness.

Focus international monitoring efforts on a more limited number of indicators and international rankings.
*   Limit the number of public governance indices compiled in the annual report on Egypt's Performance in Governance Indices in line with the objectives and indicators identified in Egypt Vision 2030; classify those indicators by public governance area and further analyse them for instance: good governance (BertelesmannStiftung, Gallup, Worldwide Governance Indicators), rule of law (Global Law and Order, Economic Freedom Index) budgeting (Open Budget, corruption/public integrity (Transparency International Corruption Perception index and World Justice Project), and digitalisation (E-government Development Index, GovTech Maturity Index); indicators on participation and satisfaction of public services could also be added (using for example the Gallup World Poll and the Arab Barometer).
*   Consider developing specific sections and analysis on competitiveness, particularly on the pillars and themes linked to governance and institutions and to sustainable development, in its report on Egypt's Performance in Governance Indices. The NIGSD could also list and monitor key indicators on competitiveness identified in Egypt Vision 2030, including the Global Competitiveness Index, the Economic Complexity Index, and the Global Sustainable Competitiveness Index as well as key data on Foreign Direct Investments, job creation, and environment (e.g. carbon emissions).

Encouraging more data sharing across institutions (e.g. leveraging MPEDIC's influence and mandate).
*   Design and adopt formal co-ordination tools for effectively engaging with partners on indicator development etc., notably with CAPMAS and the MPEDIC, so that roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, and shared activity can be pursued coherently in the areas of governance and sustainable development, notably in support of the implementation of Egypt Vision 2030, using common indicators that reflect input from all relevant government stakeholders.

# OECD Public Governance Reviews

## Institutional Review of the National Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development in Egypt

The Government of Egypt has enacted major reforms to modernise its public governance and foster inclusive and sustainable economic growth. The National Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (NIGSD) has played a key role in advancing these reforms; it is uniquely positioned as a public economic organisation with advisory, training and research functions working at the intersection of good governance, competitiveness, and sustainable development in Egypt. This Review provides an overview of the governance, functioning and activities of the NIGSD, as well as its achievements, with the aim of further enhancing its capacity and impact. In line with OECD good practices and standards, the Review also provides policy advice and recommendations on how to enhance the internal governance structures, processes and tools of the NIGSD, better mainstream governance practices and build capacities for sustainable development across sectors and levels of government.
