The UAE as a federation did not exist then. The area and the surrounding region was referred to as Arabian Peninsula. This page provides a brief about life in the area during ancient times and the major events that took place on this land that affected the sovereignty and freedom of its people and lead them to form the country of the United Arab Emirates.\nU.Ask\n6000 - 3500BC\n3200 - 1300BC\n1300 - 300BC\nAD630 - 1258\nAD1498 - 1650\nAD1622 - 1750\nAD1720 - 1968\nAD1966 - 1971\nThe Paleolithic Age (6000 - 3500BC)\nIn this period, the Bedouin communities lived on fishing and plant collecting. This era was characterised by the emergence of pottery, evidence of which was found in Sharjah, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah and Abu Dhabi.\n6000BC\nSome pottery remains almost greenish-yellow, with black, geometric decoration were uncovered in Al Jazeerah Al Hamra in Ras Al Khaimah, in Hamriyah in Sharjah and in Al Madar site in Umm Al Quwain. The pottery remains resembled those found in Mesopotamia in the same period.\nRead more\n5000BC\nThis era is characterised by wetter weather conditions. People lived on different parts of the land; along the coast and in the interiors. They depended on hunting, fishing, agriculture and animal grazing. Neolithic life in the area collapsed just after 4000BC when the climate deteriorated.\nRead more\nThe Bronze Age (3200 - 1300BC)\nThis age is divided into three periods: the Jebel Hafeet period, the Umm Al Nar period and the Wadi Suq period.\n3200BC\nThis period was named the Jebel Hafeet period because of the tombs found in Jebel Hafeet near Al Ain city in the emirate of Abu Dhabi.\nRead more\n2000BC\nThis period was named the Wadi Suq period after one of the sites in Wadi Suq, between Al Ain and the Omani coast.\nRead more\nThe Iron Age (1300 - 300BC)\nThe archaeological findings show the emergence of the first use of the falaj irrigation systems that enabled the extraction of groundwater for continuous cultivation in the dry climate.\n1300BC\nPeople in this era used ceramics, bronze, gold and iron artefacts, jewellery pieces of beads, gold, stones, as well as decorative stones, daggers, arrowheads, swords, axe heads, fish-hooks, knives and pottery. It is believed that there were metal factories.\nRead more\n1300BC\nSeveral large subterranean tombs were found. They all belonged to small farming villages on the terraces of the wadis. These tombs were built for a large group of people, who buried their dead together. The chambers of the tombs were lined with stones; they had an entrance and showed a broad variety of shapes.\nRead more\nArrival of Islam (AD630 - 1258)\nIslam arrived in the UAE after the opening of Mecca. Envoys from Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) arrived in the UAE in AD630 and introduced Islam. Thus, a new era began in the region during the emergence of Islam.\nAD630\nAmr bin al'As visited Oman and Sohar and brought the Prophet's message to the kings of Oman, while Abu Al-Ala'a Al-Hadrami visited Bahrain for the same purpose. The Gulf region willingly accepted the invitation to Islam.\nRead more\nAD750\nThe Islamic civilisation flourished in the Gulf region during the Umayyad Caliphate AD661 to 750 and Abbasid Caliphate AD750 to 1258. Sea trade prospered between the Gulf region and other areas in south east Asia and along the west African coast and ships' craftsmanship spread in the region.\nRead more\nThe Portuguese era (AD1498 - 1650)\nThe Portuguese were amongst the first Europeans to arrive on the Arabian Peninsula. After Vasco de Gamma's successful circumnavigation of the Cape of Good Hope, the Portuguese arrived in the Arabian Gulf in 1498.\nAD1515\nBy 1515, the Portuguese fought their way into the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman and established themselves there by force of arms. By 1560, they reached the height of their maritime power and established a semi-monopoly of the pepper and spice trade. They took over the role of intermediary for trade between the ports of the Indian Ocean from the members of the indigenous mercantile strata.\nRead more\nAD1633\nThen arose the Ya'arabi forces that ousted the Portuguese from Julfar and Dibba in 1633, retook Sohar in 1643 and recaptured Muscat in 1650.\nRead more\nThe Dutch era (AD1622 - 1750)\nThe loss of Hormuz by the Portuguese in 1622 marked the entry of the Dutch and the English to the Middle Eastern markets.\nAD1623\nThe Dutch concluded an agreement for the trade in silk with Shah Abbas I through which they earned an enormous profit. By the 17th century, the Dutch had become the dominant naval power in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Gulf.\nRead more\nAD1750\nBy the 1750s, the Dutch power weakened because of the three-way warfare between them, the English and the French and they lost their holdings in most of the Indian Ocean. Later, the Dutch strengthened their position on the island of Kharg by erecting a fortress and a factory and took over the various economic activities of the indigenous Arab population including pearl fishery.\nRead more\nThe British era (AD1720 - 1968)\nBy 1720s, trade by the British in the gulf had grown. The British were primarily concerned with asserting their naval power to safeguard trade links to India and keeping any European competitors out. By 1820, the British defeated the Qawasims.\nAD1820\nAfter the defeat of the Qawasims, the British signed a series of agreements from 1820 to 1853 with the sheikhs of the individual emirates. As per these agreements, the sheikhs had to ensure peace at sea and refrain from building large ships and erecting fortifications along the coast. However, regular warfare at sea between Arab tribes was prevalent.\nRead more\nAD1892\nIn 1892, they entered into Exclusive Agreements with the Trucial States by virtue of which the Trucial States could neither dispose any of their territories except to the United Kingdom nor enter into relationships with any foreign government without the consent of the United Kingdom. In return, the British would defend the emirates from foreign aggression. In early 1968, the British declared their intention to withdraw from the Gulf by the end of 1971.\nRead more\nFoundation of the UAE (AD1966 - 1971)\nSoon after assuming power on 6 August 1966, as the Ruler of Abu Dhabi, H. H. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan underscored the importance of a united country and remarked, “In harmony, in some sort of federation, we could follow the example of other developing countries.”\nAD1968\nSheikh Zayed, along with Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the then Ruler of Dubai met on 18 February 1968, at Al Samha in today’s Abu Dhabi near the south-western boundary of Dubai. From 25 to 27 February 1968, the Rulers of these nine states convened a constitutional conference in Dubai and formed an agreement of 11 points, which was the basis for efforts to establish the ‘Federation of the Arab Emirates’.\nRead more\nAD1971\nOn 18 July 1971, the Rulers of six of the seven emirates that made up the Trucial States, (except Ras Al Khaimah), decided to form a union. This meeting made the following historical declaration: “The Supreme Council felicitates the people of the United Arab Emirates, as well as the Arab people, and our friends around the world, and declares the United Arab Emirates as an independent sovereign state being a part of the Arab World.”\nRead more\n6000 - 3500BC\n3200 - 1300BC\n1300 - 300BC\nAD630 - 1258\nAD1498 - 1650\nAD1622 - 1750\nAD1720 - 1968\nAD1966 - 1971\nThis platform\nAbout U.AE\nWebsite Statistics\nDigital participation policy\nCitizen Charter\nResources\nMap\nDisclaimer\nOther websites\nDigital Government\nGovernment Data\nParticipation\nDigital Accessibility Statement\nDigital Accessibility Statement\nSite Map\nHelp and support\nGovernment Entities\nGovernment Officials\nTawasul 171\nFAQs\nContact Us\nEmergency Contacts\nHandling emergencies\nPolice: 999\nCivil Defence: 997\nAmbulance: 998\nElectricity authority: 991\nFollow Us On\nPowered by\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\nTerms and conditions\nDigital Accessibility Statement\n2025 U.ae\nAll rights reserved",

Read about the varied life here.\nU.Ask\nSocial life\nThe aspects of UAE's social life\nThe harsh climate and the mostly arid terrain played an important role in influencing the social life of people in the past.\nOne of a tribe\nEvery one belonged to one tribal group or the other and swore allegiance to it. This way, everyone was bound by obligations to protect his tribe and in turn be assured of the same for himself from the rest of his tribe members.\nThe tribal people settled and moved together in groups. The Bani Yas group was the largest tribal group. It roamed the deserts of the emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The other tribes at that time were the Awamir and Manasir that also wandered.\nThe tribes wandered with their camels in search of greener lands for themselves and their cattle. Almost all Bani Yas families, except the Al Rumaitha, who were into fishing, returned to their dwelling in the oases of Liwa occasionally.\nWater: key to economic and social structure\nAs per the book 'The Tribal Society of the UAE and its Traditional Economy' by Frauke Heard-Bey, the availability of water was key to the economic life and hence the social structure of the then UAE. The country can be broadly divided into three geographically and therefore economically different regions: firstly, the coasts and islands; secondly, the Hajar mountain range with its valleys (wadis) and adjacent gravel plains; and thirdly, the sandy desert.\nLife by the coast\nOn the islands of Abu Dhabi, archaeological evidences show that tribespeople came to fish in the winter and even brought their camels over in boats. They used rainwater, stored in cisterns, or caught in horizontally placed sails.\nWith the rise of pearling industry, many families moved to the coast. Thus, increasing the size and importance of Abu Dhabi and Dubai.\nLife in the oases\nThe pearling industry resulted in families gathering wealth. Some of these moved to Al Ain and started date farming. They put some of their wealth in bringing underground water for the date farms from springs near the mountains to the plains. The area and its economy started thriving after the availability of water.\nLife in the desert\nBedouins had found a way to live in the harsh desert. In the deserts of Empty Quarter in Abu Dhabi, sometimes, they could find water in the dunes, which was potable, sweet and adequate for their population. They even created date gardens and built themselves houses using the branches of the date palms.\nThe camel supported the bedouin in their daily life struggle. The camel was not only a mode of transport but also a source of food and a thing of entertainment and utility. Camels were herded for their milk and meat. They were also raced for fun as a sport. Camel hide was used to make bags and other useful utensils, while some of the finest mens' outer garments (bisht) were woven from their hair.\nFoundation of the governance culture\nThe culture of sharing and participation is intrinsic to the Emirati culture. In the olden days, the ruling Sheikhs used to travel to remote lands in the UAE and camp in villages where they would hold ad hoc meetings in large tents. These meetings were informal in nature and largely involved sharing, discussing and resolving local issues relating to society, agriculture, trade and economy, housing, medical and other topics relating to the well-being and happiness of the people. These meetings were referred to as Barza or Majlis (Arabic words for gatherings) and drew Emiratis in huge numbers.\nThe UAE society today\nThe UAE's population was estimated to be around 8.2 million around mid-2010. The UAE Government has invested its wealth from oil in building a nation with world-class infrastructure. Emiratis now have access to good education, health services, housing and other vital infrastructure such as public works, banks, telecommunication etc. The UAE leads the Arab region in many of these sectors.\nOwing to their earlier practice of settling in groups, even today, Emirati families live together. They stand for cohesiveness bound by religious and tribal ties and traditional values of cooperating and sharing.\nEmiratis are social. They like to meet people and continue to hold regular gatherings at home or social venues. They are warm hosts and treat their guests with utmost honour. An Emirati man greets another Emirati man by rubbing his nose against the other's nose. A handshake, an embrace and greetings of peace follow.\nEconomic factors still affect social lifestyle. Yet, the one thing that did not change is that the Emirati culture resonates Islamic values.\nSourced from:\nUAE Interact website\nThe book 'The Tribal Society of the UAE and its Traditional Economy' by Frauke Heard-Bey\nUseful links:\nArabian hospitality\n- VisitAbuDhabi.com\nMajlis\n- VisitAbuDhabi.com\nUpdated on:\n21 Jul 2025\nDid you find this content useful?\nYou can help us improve by providing your feedback about your experience.\nYes\nN0\nThank you for your feedback.\nHave you used our services at our service center or digitally recently?\nGive us your feedback\nSubmit\nThank you for your feedback.\nThis platform\nAbout U.AE\nWebsite Statistics\nDigital participation policy\nCitizen Charter\nResources\nMap\nDisclaimer\nOther websites\nDigital Government\nGovernment Data\nParticipation\nDigital Accessibility Statement\nDigital Accessibility Statement\nSite Map\nHelp and support\nGovernment Entities\nGovernment Officials\nTawasul 171\nFAQs\nContact Us\nEmergency Contacts\nHandling emergencies\nPolice: 999\nCivil Defence: 997\nAmbulance: 998\nElectricity authority: 991\nFollow Us On\nPowered by\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\nTerms and conditions\nDigital Accessibility Statement\n2025 U.ae\nAll rights reserved",

Today, paintings and literature have joined the art forms thriving in the UAE.\nU.Ask\nPoetry\nMusic and dance\nCrafts\nPaintings and literature\nPoetry\nTraditional UAE's literary heritage comprises\nTaghrouda\nand\nNabati poetry. Taghrouda involves a poetry duel. This art was practised in rural areas to hasten the search for a lost camel or horse. Al Taghrouda, which is popular at weddings, is also performed on horseback to urge horses to speed up. The equestrian taghrouda is usually about courage, bravery and magnanimity.\nNabati refers to the dialect of Arabic spoken by non-Arabic natives. Nabati poetry has been a feature of life in the Arabian Peninsula since the 16th century. H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum\ncomposes Nabati poetry. He has published\ncompilations of such compositions.\nRead more about Nabati poetry on the website of Abu Dhabi Culture.\nMusic and dance\nMusic and dance\nwere widely practised in the olden days.\nAyala or the 'stick dance' is one of the folk dance forms. It involves performances by two rows of dancers facing one another. Dancers are positioned close together in rows, signifying the unity and co-operation amongst tribal people. It is accompanied by drumming.\nAl Wahabiyyah\nis one of the oldest art forms of Ras Al Khaimah and is performed only here. The songs during this performance are divided into three sections. Drum players stand between two rows of performers comprising the band. One of the performers begins by reciting a line of poetry. He repeats it a number of times until the other performers have memorised it. Then he recites another line of poetry from the same poem. The first line is a start and the second is the ostinato or pedal.\nThe two rows of dancers rhythmically move forward and backward, a row bows and drummers keep drawing nearer to it for 10 minutes while moving their heads. The opposite row repeats the some movements as the drummers draw nearer to them as well. Dancers with swords and guns add charm to the show.\nToday, Emiratis play traditional music and perform traditional dances on important social occasions.\nCrafts\nCrafts such as\npottery,\nweaving\nand\nembroidery\nhave been part of the Emirati culture since the time they lived as bedouins. In fact, pottery can be traced back to the Paleolithic Age (6000 B.C. - 3500 B.C.). The Emirati traditional form of weaving, known as Sadu, is on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's 'List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding'.\nPaintings and literature\nThere are several art galleries, art districts and art museums in the cities of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah. Today, the UAE is emerging as an international hub for promoting art and culture. The UAE is venue for several art and literature exhibitions and festivals.\nSome of the renowned local art exhibitions are\nAbu Dhabi Art, Art\nDubai and\nSharjah Biennale.

Hence, the Emiratis relied on animal products. Some Emirati dishes have a hint of Arabian, Indian, Iranian, Mediterranean and Turkish influences.\nU.Ask\nBread and pancakes\nCoffee and dates\nFish, meat, rice and spice\nDining scene today\nBread and pancakes\nBread and pancakes were popular before rice came in. The Arabic bread Khameer (which is the Arabic word for yeast) is made from yeast, flour and powdered milk. It is sprinkled with sesame seeds and served with cheese or honey.\nThe Emirati pancake, Chabab, is made with flour, eggs, sugar and spices like cardamom and saffron. It is served with date syrup.\nCoffee and dates\nGuests and visitors are traditionally welcomed with\ncoffee\nand\ndates. Local coffee comes blended with cardamom and saffron. Coffee is served in small handle-less cups called finjans.\nDate palms flourish in the oases. Dates are considered a boon in the desert, as they are a vital source of nutrition. Even today, fasts during the holy month of Ramadan are broken with dates. Dibs or date syrup, is used as a dip to relish both savoury and sweet dishes. More than 40 varieties of dates are grown in the UAE; each having its own distinct colour and flavour.\nIn the olden days, dates were fermented in the sun to act as a raising agent to prepare bread. Today, dates coated in chocolate or stuffed with almonds or candied orange peel make for luxury gifts.\nCoffee (called Gahwa in Arabic) and dates (called Tamr in Arabic) are still an integral part of the Emirati culture.\nFish, meat, rice and spice\nAlong the coasts, fish was found in abundance. The Emiratis learnt to store fish by drying it and made it accessible to those living in the deserts and oases.\nIn the deserts and mountainous regions, Emiratis largely relied on camel milk and meat. Meat of sheep and goat were also staple.\nForeign trade led to import of spices and later rice. The availability of rice and spice led to the invention of dishes such as Khuzi (stuffed whole roast lamb or goat on a bed of spiced rice), Machboos (casserole of lamb or chicken layered with rice seasoned with spices and some saffron) and Biryani (meat cooked with Indian-style spiced rice).\nCinnamon, saffron and turmeric, along with nuts, limes and dried fruit heighten the flavour of Emirati dishes. Spices were also used to prepare fish dishes such as Machboos, Saloona (stew), Mhammar and Al Madrooba. Mhammar is a side dish where the fish are spiced and prepared whole. It is often served with sweet caramelised onions and sugary yellow rice, which is a blend of savoury and sweet.\nEmiratis also favour the other dish, Al Madrooba. It is a mix of salted fish, spices and thick sauce. It is sprinkled with saffron, nuts and spices and served with rice.\nDining scene today\nToday, the dining scene in the UAE has undergone a huge change. The UAE has many restaurants, cafés and bars. Popular cuisines served in restaurants are Afghani, African, American, Arabic, British, Chinese, Filipino, French, German, Greek, Indian, Indonesian, Iranian, Italian, Japanese, Malay, Mediterranean, Mexican, Nepali, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Thai and Vietnamese.\nFood festivals\nTaste of Abu Dhabi, Dubai Food Festival and Sharjah Food Festival bring cuisines from around the world and are popular with citizens and residents alike.\nRead more about food and\ndining in 'dining\nin the UAE'.\nSourced from:\nSheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Centre for Cultural Understanding\nThe official portal of tourism in Abu Dhabi - VisitAbuDhabi.ae\nFor further reading:\nLocal cuisine\n- VisitAbuDhabi.ae\nCoffee and dates\n- VisitAbuDhabi.ae\nDiscover Dubai's delicious Emirati cuisine - Visitdubai.com\nBread and pancakes\nCoffee and dates\nFish, meat, rice and spice\nDining scene today\nUpdated on:\n30 Dec 2024\nDid you find this content useful?\nYou can help us improve by providing your feedback about your experience.\nYes\nN0\nThank you for your feedback.\nHave you used our services at our service center or digitally recently?\nGive us your feedback\nSubmit\nThank you for your feedback.\nThis platform\nAbout U.AE\nWebsite Statistics\nDigital participation policy\nCitizen Charter\nResources\nMap\nDisclaimer\nOther websites\nDigital Government\nGovernment Data\nParticipation\nDigital Accessibility Statement\nDigital Accessibility Statement\nSite Map\nHelp and support\nGovernment Entities\nGovernment Officials\nTawasul 171\nFAQs\nContact Us\nEmergency Contacts\nHandling emergencies\nPolice: 999\nCivil Defence: 997\nAmbulance: 998\nElectricity authority: 991\nFollow Us On\nPowered by\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\nTerms and conditions\nDigital Accessibility Statement\n2025 U.ae\nAll rights reserved",

It includes Federal Supreme Court, Federal courts and Public Prosecution. It is presided by the Federal Supreme Court as the highest judicial authority in the UAE.\nU.Ask\nFederal judiciary as per the UAE's Constitution\nStructure of the judicial system\nMinistry of Justice\nFederal judicial authority\nSmart transformation of the judicial system\nThe system of courts\nMixed legal system\nFederal judiciary as per the UAE's Constitution\nAs per Article 45 of the UAE's Constitution, the Federal Judiciary is one of the five bodies that comprise the federal authorities of the UAE Government.\nThe independence of the Emirati judiciary supports the country's stability and wellbeing. The UAE judiciary is entirely independent and judges are subject to no authority other than the rule of law and their conscience. Cases are handled by the UAE courts fairly and without interference from any power whatsoever.\nThe UAE's Constitution and the President guarantee the value of the mission of justice and respect for judges and judicial bodies. Article 94 of the Constitution stipulates: Justice is the basis of rule. In performing their duties, judges shall be independent and shall not be subject to any authority but the law and their own conscience.\nAll defendants, whether Emiratis or expatriates enjoy the right to a fair trial and this right is clearly protected in the UAE's laws.\nStructure of the judicial system\nThe legal structure in the UAE runs in two systems: the Federal Judiciary presided by the Federal Supreme Court as the highest judicial authority in the UAE and the local judicial departments at the local government level.\nAt the federal level,\nMinistry of Justice\noversees courts and prosecution departments across the UAE. It appoints judges and licenses lawyers, experts and legal translators.\nArticles 94 to 109 of the\nUAE's Constitution\ndescribe the general principles of these two systems and leave the details to the discretion of local judiciaries. Each of the seven emirates maintain the right to choose either to participate in the Federal Judiciary or to maintain its own local judicial system. The emirates of Sharjah, Ajman Fujairah and Umm Al Quwain follow the federal judicial system.\nHowever, at the local level,\nAbu Dhabi Judicial Department\nin Abu Dhabi,\nDubai Courts\nin Dubai and\nRAK Courts\nin Ras Al Khaimah maintain their own independent judicial departments, with jurisdiction in matters that were not assigned to the Federal Judiciary in accordance with the Constitution.\nJurisdiction\nArticle 105 of the Constitution allows by federal law, for all or part of a local emirate court's jurisdiction to be referred to the federal courts of first instance. However, it is not possible for a local emirate court to take jurisdiction away from the federal court.\nAppeals\nFederal laws define the circumstances in which appeals against judgements by the local judicial authorities in penal, civil, commercial and other cases may be made before the federal courts.\nThe Constitution explains that there are some disputes that must be heard at a federal level by the Federal Supreme Court and not at a local or emirate's level. These are detailed in Articles 99 and 102 of the Constitution.\nFederal Law No. 10 of 2019 regulates judicial relationships between federal and local judicial authorities.\nMinistry of Justice\nAt the federal level, the\nMinistry of Justice\noversees courts and prosecution departments across the UAE. It appoints judges and licenses lawyers, experts and legal translators. It proposes and implements amendments to the rules of procedure for civil and criminal litigation as would serve the interests of justice.\nAccording to Article 6 of Federal Law No. 1 of 1972 on the Jurisdictions of the Ministries and the Competences of the Ministers, its jurisdiction involves:\nregulating and supervising the administrative and financial affairs of the federal courts\npreparing draft laws related to the Federal Judiciary, the federal public prosecution, general amnesty from the judgements issued by the federal courts\nperusing the studies, fatwas and all other legal affairs required by the work needs in different federal ministries\npreparing\nmajor draft legislations related to the laws on real\nestate, the expropriation for the public interest, penal law, civil and commercial procedures laws, companies law, procedures before civil and criminal courts, laws of protection of literary, artistic and industrial property, copyrights and laws of extradition of criminals.\nUseful links:\nAbu Dhabi Judicial Department\nDubai Courts\nRAK Courts\nFrom a tribe's sheikh to judge: How UAE's judicial system has evolved\nFederal judicial authority\nAs per the UAE's Constitution, the Federal Judiciary enjoys full independence and justice is the basis of its authority. All are equal before the law, regardless of race, nationality and religion. The Constitution does not allow arbitrary arrest, inhumane treatment and illegal intrusion to private properties.\nThe UAE Federal Judiciary includes:\nFederal Supreme Court\nFederal courts\nPublic Prosecution.\nThe Federal Supreme Court\nThe first mention of the\nFederal Supreme Court\nwas in 1968 when both late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and late Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, concluded an agreement on a federation between them. Federal Decree by Law No. 33 of 2022 Concerning the Supreme Federal Court regulates the functions of the Federal Supreme Court.\nAppointment and term of the judges of the Federal Supreme Court\nThe Supreme Court maintains five judges appointed by the President of the UAE, after an approval by the Federal Supreme Council.\nThe President and the judges of the Supreme Court cannot be removed and their services cannot be ended except for the following reasons:\ndeath\nresignation\ncompletion of term of contract for individuals on contract or completion of the term of secondment\nretirement\npermanent incapacity to carry the burdens of their duties by reasons of ill health\ndisciplinary discharge on the basis of the reasons and proceedings stipulated in the law\nappointment to other offices, with their agreement.\nKey competencies of the UAE's Supreme Court\nExclusively, the Supreme Court handles:\ndisputes between member emirates, or between any one or more emirate and the Federal\nGovernment\nconstitutionality of the federal laws and\nthe constitutional legality of legislations enacted by local emirates if they are challenged by the federal laws or the Constitution\nexamination of the constitutional legality of laws if such a request is referred by any state court\nconstitutional interpretations if requested by federal entity or any emirate\ninterrogation of Ministers and senior federal officials on the basis of a request by the Federal Supreme Council\ncrimes directly affecting the interests of the federation; such as crimes relating to internal or external security, forgery of the official records or seals\nconflict of jurisdiction between federal judicial authorities and the local judicial authorities\nconflict of jurisdiction between the judicial authority in one emirate and the judicial authority in another emirate and the classification of the principles relating to it in a federal law.\nThe judgements of the Supreme Court are final and binding upon all.\nDeath sentences must be approved by the President or may be substituted to a lesser sentence in accordance with stipulated procedures. The President may grant pardon from the execution of any sentence passed by the Federal Judiciary.\nFederal courts\nThe UAE maintains one or more federal courts of the first instance in the permanent capital of the federation or in the capitals of some of the emirates, in order to exercise the judicial powers, within their jurisdiction, in the following cases:\ncivil, commercial and administrative disputes between the Federation and the individuals, whether the Federation is plaintiff or defendant\ncrimes committed within the boundaries of the permanent capital of the Federation\npersonal status actions, civil actions, commercial actions and other actions between individuals which arise in the permanent capital of the Federation.\nThe law regulates all matters connected with the federal courts of the first instance in respect of their organisation, formation, departments, local jurisdiction, procedures to be followed before them, the oaths to be sworn by their judges, conditions of service for their judges and the means of appealing against their judgements.\nPublic Prosecution\nThe Public Prosecution\nis another component of the Federal Judiciary system in the UAE. The Constitution states that the Federation maintains a Public Prosecutor appointed by a federal decree, with the agreement of the Cabinet.\nThe\nFederal Law No. 35 of 1992\nconcerning the Criminal Procedural Law as amended prescribes the jurisdiction of this entity, its procedures and the powers of its assistants over the police and the public security services.\nSmart transformation of the judicial system\nAiming to speed up litigations before courts, the Ministry of Justice had, as of May 2015, transformed 95 per cent of its services into electronic services.\nSome of these\nservices\ninclude search of status of a\ncase,\nwhich enables people to view the hearing schedule online. In addition, it has engines for:\neSessions\nsearching lawyers\neNotary public\neFiling\neMarriage\neRefund.\nThe Case Management System (CMS) helps people to file documents electronically, reduces delays in civil court cases and improves efficiency by making information more accessible to all parties.\nFurther, Ministry of Justice launched the\nlegislations ePortal\n(in Arabic and English) which contains all the general legal texts published in the Official Gazette since the establishment of the UAE in 1971. It also provide access to the following:\nthe UAE Legislation (in Arabic)\nthe UAE laws in English\nthe UAE High Court case decisions (both civil and criminal)\nthe consultations of the department of consultations (Fatwa) and legislations of Ministry of Justice\nthe International Treaties signed and ratified by the UAE classified by countries and subjects.\nLocal judicial departments have also adopted eServices for litigants and legal professionals to avail information about all the cases and procedures.\nUseful links:\nDigital judicial services\n- Abu Dhabi Judicial Department\nPublic services\n- Dubai Courts\neApplication - Dubai Courts\nThe system of courts\nThree levels of court\nTo achieve the full extent of justice, the UAE adopts three levels of courts for litigation purposes. This system enables effected party to challenge the case and present more evidence within the provisions of the law. The courts' degrees in the UAE are:\nCourt of First Instance (federal and local)\nCourt of Appeal (federal and local)\nFederal Supreme Court (at the federal level) and the Court of Cassation at the local level of the emirates which have independent judicial departments.\nIf the ruling of the Court of First Instance is not satisfactory, it can be challenged before the Court of Appeal and then the Court of Cassation according to Federal Law By Decree No. 42 of 2022 Promulgating the Civil Procedures Law (in Arabic).\nCourt of First Instance\nCourt of First Instance is the first degree of litigation and has the jurisdiction to hear all civil, commercial, administrative, labour and personal status lawsuits. Its jurisdiction includes examining statement of claims, authentication of documents, all urgent matters related to disputes among the people and safeguarding their rights. It is also in charge of enforcing judicial execution deeds, as well as executions by deputation or reference.\nCourt of Appeal\nCourt of Appeal is the second degree of litigation which entitles the litigant affected by the Court of First Instance to appeal his/her case before a higher court in accordance with the provisions of the civil and criminal procedural laws effective in the UAE.\nOnly the convicted may appeal the court judgement. Thus, appeal is not possible to anyone who accepts the ruling explicitly or implicitly.\nThe time limit to challenge a ruling starts from the day following its issuance, unless the law provides otherwise. The time limit for appeal shall be 30 days unless otherwise provided by the law, and 10 days in urgent cases. The failure to observe the time limits of appeal in the judgements results in the extinguishment of the right of appeal.\nCourt of Cassation\nCourt of Cassation is the higher judicial body with power to try cases contested by the Court of Appeals. It supervises the interpretation of laws and its proper enforcement.\nAt this court, litigants may appeal only on points of law alone, such as violation of law or on erroneous application or interpretation. The appeal must be filed within 60 days of the judgement of the Court of Appeal if the value claimed in the action exceeds AED 200,000 or cannot be evaluated.\nAll decisions of Court of Cassation are final and binding and are not subject to appeal.\nUseful links:\nThe court system in Abu Dhabi\n- the Abu Dhabi eGovernment Gateway\nAbout courts in Dubai - Dubai Courts\nCourt circuits\nJudicial circuits are branches of court according to specialty and jurisdiction. Each level of court has a circuit to look into the various types of cases such as: personal status cases, criminal cases and civil cases. The division is based on the scope of the case and expertise of the judges. Each court is presided over by a president and supported by a judge or number of judges and administrative staff. In addition, each court has judicial circuits including personal status, civil, criminal, commercial, labour and real estate.\nThe litigant should know the category into which his lawsuit falls to determine the court circuit that would hear his case.\nThe court circuits are major and minor which differ depending on the value , the type of the case, and the number of judges.\nMinor circuits\nThe minor circuits are formed by a single judge, who issues first instance judgements on civil, commercial, and labour\nactions, whose value does not exceed AED 500,000 and counterclaims whatever was their value.\nAlso it reviews actions on :\npersonal status\ndivision of common property\nthose related to the claim and specification of wages and salaries whatever was their value.\nIn all cases, the minor circuits' judgements shall be final if the value of the lawsuit does not exceed AED 20,000.\nMajor circuits\nThe major circuits are formed of three judges. They have jurisdiction over all civil, commercial and labour actions, which do not fall within the jurisdiction of the minor circuits. In addition, they handle:\nadministrative and real estate actions irrespective of their value\ntemporary or summary claims and all other counterclaims, as well as the claims related to the original request\nbankruptcy and preventive composition lawsuits.\nLabour court\nLabour courts handle cases relating to labour disputes in the private sector. They apply the Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 Regarding the Regulation of Employment Relationship and  Cabinet Regulation No. 1 of 2022.\nLabour disputes usually concern non-payment of salaries and end of service benefits, rejection of leave and compensation for arbitrary dismissal.\nWorkers are exempt from paying litigation fees for claims less than AED 100,000.\nPersonal status court (Sharia)\nPersonal status court handles all family cases related to matters such as marriage, divorce, alimony, guardianship, custody and visitation, proof of maturity, proof of lineage and inheritance.\nFederal Law No. 28 of 2005\napplies to personal status cases. Article 1 of the Law provides that the Law shall apply to all UAE nationals except non-Muslims in which case they shall be governed by special rules relating to their specific creed or sect.\nThe Family Guidance Section usually handles personal status cases free of charge before they are referred to trial at the Court of First Instance.\nIf both parties fail to reach an amicable agreement, the dispute will be referred to the Court of First Instance after the payment of the court fee, if applicable.\nCivil courts\nCivil courts handle the cases related to the financial rights of individuals and legal entities such as government departments, companies and institutions. The cases can be related to disputes about validity, implementation, cancellation or termination of contracts, intellectual properties, lands and mortgages.\nThe major circuit of the Court of First Instance is responsible for hearing cases with a claimed value of more than AED 100,000, while cases below this value are brought before the minor circuit.\nFederal Law No. 5 of 1985\n(text in Arabic) applies to civil cases.\nCommercial courts\nCommercial courts handle commercial contracts and commitments, banking processes, commercial papers, bankruptcy and its reconciliation issues.\nFederal Decree Law No. 50 of 2022 Promulgating the Commercial Transactions Law regulates types of cases related to above issues.\nCriminal courts\nThese courts handle criminal cases initiated by the federal or local prosecution in each emirate.\nFind related laws:\nFederal Decree by Law No. 38 of 2022 Promulgating the Criminal Procedures Law\nFederal Law by Decree No. 31 of 2021 Promulgating the Crimes and Penalties Law\nMixed legal system\nThe UAE adopts a dual legal system of civil and Sharia laws, and recently the system has been extended to include the common law as being practised\nin Dubai International Financial Centre Courts (DIFC).\nThe principles of the UAE's laws are drawn basically from Islamic Sharia (the system of law). However, most codified legislations in the UAE are a mixture between Islamic laws and other civil laws such as the Egyptian and French civil laws.\nThe UAE civil law system includes all relevant laws which are largely codified and adapted to meet the evolving needs of business demands, locally and internationally. In parallel to the civil dominating jurisdiction, the UAE adopts the Sharia law system, which works alongside the civil and criminal courts, particularly within personal status courts.\nBasis of Sharia laws\nIslamic Sharia is one of the sources of the UAE's laws. The UAE's Constitution provides that Islam is the official religion of the Federation and the Islamic Sharia is a main source of its legislation.\nSharia is derived from several sources. Some of them are:\nThe Holy Koran (Qu'ran), which is the principal source, being the word of Allah\nThe 'Sunnah', which are the verbal teachings of Prophet Mohammed\nThe 'Ijma', which is a consensus among religious scholars regarding solutions to matters not covered in the Koran or the Sunnah\nAnalogous 'Qiyas', which is applied in the absence of a basis for a clear decision and which is drawn in conjunction with the three other sources of law.\nFederal Law No. 5 of 1985\non Civil Transactions (Arabic) provides that in absence of a provision in civil law, the judge shall pass a judgement according to Islamic Sharia.\nThe role of Sharia laws in the UAE's courts\nThe UAE's Sharia courts have the exclusive jurisdiction to hear family disputes, including matters of divorce, inheritance, child custody, child abuse and guardianship of minors.\nIslamic marriages are also conducted according to the Sharia provisions in Sharia courts, or through the courts' authorised marriage officers (Mazoons) in each emirate.\nMinistry of Justice has launched the\neMarriage service\nthat helps couples wishing to get married to book an appointment with a marriage officer.\nBoth, the\nJudicial Department in Abu Dhabi\nand\nDubai Courts\nfacilitate online marriage applications and the services of marriage officers.\nUsually, the judges of Sharia courts are trained in Islamic Jurisprudence and Law. In addition, the UAE's courts may rely on principles of Islamic jurisprudence in the construction and interpretation of the UAE laws.\nInfluence of Sharia laws on the UAE's businesses\nIn the UAE, the Islamic laws reflect on the business sector. For instance, the UAE has enacted legal provisions which prohibit unjustified enrichment and transactions that contain excessive risk or speculation.\nThree Sharia principles form the benchmark of Islamic economics. They are:\nprohibition of interest (Riba)\nprofit and loss sharing\nuncertainty and speculation (Gharar).\nThese three principals have created the opportunity for Islamic finance to grow in the UAE.\nOther reflections of the Sharia principles on the UAE's business laws are:\nthe requirements relating to capacity to contract\nthe conditions for clarity of contractual terms\nthe absence of constraints\nthe specific conditions governing sale and purchase transactions.\nIn addition, the Islamic financial institutions in the UAE offer many Sharia-compliant products. These products are supported by the normal supplementary services such as the provision of cheque books, internet banking and Sharia compliant credit cards.\nRelated links\nDubai Islamic Bank\nUnderstanding Islamic banking\n- Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank\nState of global Islamic economy 2016/2017 - Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre\nState of global Islamic economy 2017/2018 - Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre\nState of global Islamic economy 2018/2019 -\nDubai Islamic Economy Development Centre\nFederal judiciary as per the UAE's Constitution\nStructure of the judicial system\nMinistry of Justice\nFederal judicial authority\nSmart transformation of the judicial system\nThe system of courts\nMixed legal system\nUpdated on:\n30 Dec 2024\nDid you find this content useful?\nYou can help us improve by providing your feedback about your experience.\nYes\nN0\nThank you for your feedback.\nHave you used our services at our service center or digitally recently?\nGive us your feedback\nSubmit\nThank you for your feedback.\nThis platform\nAbout U.AE\nWebsite Statistics\nDigital participation policy\nCitizen Charter\nResources\nMap\nDisclaimer\nOther websites\nDigital Government\nGovernment Data\nParticipation\nDigital Accessibility Statement\nDigital Accessibility Statement\nSite Map\nHelp and support\nGovernment Entities\nGovernment Officials\nTawasul 171\nFAQs\nContact Us\nEmergency Contacts\nHandling emergencies\nPolice: 999\nCivil Defence: 997\nAmbulance: 998\nElectricity authority: 991\nFollow Us On\nPowered by\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\nTerms and conditions\nDigital Accessibility Statement\n2025 U.ae\nAll rights reserved",

Each local government has an executive council which works under the supervision of the Ruler's Court of that emirate, in addition to a number of autonomous agencies with clearly specified powers.\nU.Ask\nJurisdiction of the local governments\nStructure of the local governments\nCrown Princes\nDeputy Rulers\nLocal authorities\nJurisdiction of the local governments\nSimilar to many countries around the world, the UAE Federation keeps certain powers within the scope of the individual emirates, which already had their own governing institutions prior to the establishment of the Federation in 1971.\nUnder the UAE's Constitution, Rulers of the emirates may give up certain areas of authority to the Federal Government. Moreover, as a result of the country's rapid economic and social development, local governments in each emirate may assume or re-assume some functions that had previously been voluntarily assigned to the Federal Government.\nArticle 122 of the Constitution states that the emirates shall have jurisdiction in all matters not assigned to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federation in accordance with the provisions of Articles 120 and 121.\nStructure of the local governments\nThe local governments of the seven emirates differ in size and mechanisms depending on factors such as population, area and degree of development. In each emirate, there is an executive council which works under the supervision of the Ruler's Court of that emirate, in addition to a number of autonomous agencies with clearly specified powers. Here is a brief on the structure of local governments in each of the seven emirates.\nAbu Dhabi\nAbu Dhabi has its own central governing organ, the\nExecutive Council. The Council assists the Ruler to carry out his duties and powers.\nUnder this Council, there are several departments and municipalities, which carry out the emirate's plans and policies.\nUseful links:\nList of Abu Dhabi Government's departments - The Abu Dhabi eGovernment Gateway\nDubai\nThe\nDubai Executive Council\n(DEC) is the main decision-making government entity in Dubai, with regard to maintaining the city's security and order, providing public utilities and achieving its economic and social progress. The Council assists H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Ruler of Dubai in preparing development plans for the emirate and formulating local legislation. The Council is headed by Crown Prince H. H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.\nUseful links:\nList of Dubai Government's departments\n- The Official Portal of Dubai Government\nThe eight principles of Dubai governance\nOn 5 January 2019, marking the completion of 50 years of his service, H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai shared eight principles upon which Dubai was founded and has been governed over the years.\nAs the Ruler of Dubai, H. H. called on all those in a position of responsibility in the emirate to abide by these principles, ensuring their implementation at all events and times. These principles will “ensure the well-being of our people, the sustained progress of our nation and the welfare of our future generations”, said H. H. in a signed letter.\nThe eight principles are:\nThe Union is the Foundation\nNo One is Above the Law\nWe are a Business Capital\nThree Factors Drive Growth\nOur Society has a Unique Personality\nWe Believe in Economic Diversification\nA Land for Talent\nWe Care about Future Generations.\nRead the full document of the Eight Principles of Dubai.\nSharjah\nSharjah has an\nExecutive Council\nin addition to a Consultative Council. Sharjah, with three enclaves on the country's east coast, has adopted the practice of devolving some authority on a local basis with the branches of the Emiri Diwan (Court) which is headed by Deputy Chairmen in Kalba and Khor Fakkan.\nOther emirates\nA similar pattern of Councils, municipalities, departments and autonomous agencies exists in the other emirates.\nRefer to the links below for a list of local government entities in Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah:\nList of Ajman Government's departments\n- Government of Ajman\nList of Umm Al Quwain Government's departments\n- Government of Umm Al Quwain\nList of Ras Al Khaimah Government's departments\n- Government of Ras Al Khaimah\nList of Fujairah Government's departments\n- Government of Fujairah.\nCrown Princes\nEvery emirate has a Crown Prince.\nH.H.

Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammed bin Sultan Al Qasimi is the Crown Prince of Sharjah.\nH. H. Sheikh Ammar bin Humaid Al Nuaimi is the Crown Prince of Ajman.\nH. H.

The Ruler of each emirate is succeeded by its Crown Prince.\nEach emirate assumes the administration of its local government entities in collaboration with the federal authorities as provided for under the Constitution.\nArticle 122 of the Constitution gives the local emirates jurisdiction in all matters not assigned to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federation.\nEach emirate shall contribute to building and protecting the Constitution as well as benefiting from its services. All member emirates shall strive to coordinate their legislatures in all areas for standardisation purposes.\nArticle 127 of the UAE's Constitution provides that each member emirate shall contribute a specified proportion of their annual revenues to cover the annual general budget expenditure of the Federation.\nArticles 116-119 demonstrate key powers of the member emirates.\nJurisdiction of the local governments\nStructure of the local governments\nCrown Princes\nDeputy Rulers\nLocal authorities\nUpdated on:\n30 Dec 2024\nDid you find this content useful?\nYou can help us improve by providing your feedback about your experience.\nYes\nN0\nThank you for your feedback.\nHave you used our services at our service center or digitally recently?\nGive us your feedback\nSubmit\nThank you for your feedback.\nThis platform\nAbout U.AE\nWebsite Statistics\nDigital participation policy\nCitizen Charter\nResources\nMap\nDisclaimer\nOther websites\nDigital Government\nGovernment Data\nParticipation\nDigital Accessibility Statement\nDigital Accessibility Statement\nSite Map\nHelp and support\nGovernment Entities\nGovernment Officials\nTawasul 171\nFAQs\nContact Us\nEmergency Contacts\nHandling emergencies\nPolice: 999\nCivil Defence: 997\nAmbulance: 998\nElectricity authority: 991\nFollow Us On\nPowered by\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\nTerms and conditions\nDigital Accessibility Statement\n2025 U.ae\nAll rights reserved",
