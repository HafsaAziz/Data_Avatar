# 9. Conclusion and Next Steps

Egypt places significant emphasis on the advancement of AI, as seen in the government's robust financial and policy backing for AI technologies. Egypt is steadily building a strong basis for the advancement of AI, from creative R&D to increasing investment. Egypt has made great strides toward establishing an environment that is favorable to the development of AI, as evident in its vision, governance, digital capabilities, and data accessibility. These developments have not only increased Egypt's standing in the global AI community but have also drawn more investment from both domestic and foreign sources and bolstered the growth of the regional technology sector.

The roadmap for further development has been laid out, and the Egyptian government intends to initiate a new phase of its "National AI Strategy." Egypt is anticipated to grow into a significant hub for the development of AI in the Middle East and Africa. The strategy aims to further solidify Egypt's status as a regional AI hub.

We suggested the Capacity Assessment Framework (CAF) approach as a way to thoroughly evaluate Egypt's capacity for AI development. To begin, a thorough and methodical analysis of the worldwide AI indices has been performed, such as the OECD Digital Government Index, Stanford University's HAI worldwide AI Index, the Government AI Readiness Index, and Tortoise Media's Global AI Index. Thus, attention must be given to 89 critical indicators. Secondly, to ascertain the goals, prospects, and obstacles of AI development in Egypt, we conducted investigations with important government, industrial, and academic stakeholders. Moreover, Egypt has carried out comparative studies on several nations—China, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Brazil—that have led the way in AI development.

Given the developments in cloud computing, big data, and AI, Egypt has a promising future for AI growth with continued investment and strategy implementation across 21 initiatives across governance, technology, data, infrastructure, ecosystem, and talent. Cloud computing facilitates the rapid development and application of AI. Besides, AI requires enormous data sets. Egypt will place a high priority on protecting its data resources, especially by keeping data inside its borders and preventing it from leaving the nation. In this approach, the country will benefit from investments in local data infrastructure, from AI applications generating new jobs and tax money locally, and from AI applications across a range of industries based on data resources.

Egypt would enhance its international influence, share best practices, and make better use of global resources by fortifying its partnerships with individual nations and international organizations. Egypt's growth in the global AI competitiveness rankings will also reflect its aspirations and accomplishments as a rising digital powerhouse, as it takes a more prominent role in local AI efforts.
